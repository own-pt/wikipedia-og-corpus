      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7737">The [[American Petroleum Institute]] gravity, or '''API gravity''', is a measure of how heavy or light a [[petroleum]] liquid is compared to water: if its API gravity is greater than 10, it is lighter and floats on water; if less than 10, it is heavier and sinks.

API gravity is thus an inverse measure of a petroleum liquid's [[density]] relative to that of water (also known as [[specific gravity]]). It is used to compare densities of [[List of crude oil products|petroleum liquids]]. For example, if one petroleum liquid is less dense than another, it has a greater API gravity. Although API gravity is mathematically a [[dimensionless quantity]] (see the formula below), it is referred to as being in 'degrees'. API gravity is graduated in degrees on a [[hydrometer]] instrument. API gravity values of most petroleum liquids  fall between 10 and 70 degrees.


In 1916, the U.S. [[National Bureau of Standards]] accepted the [[Baumé scale]], which had been developed in France in 1768, as the U.S. standard for measuring the [[specific gravity]] of liquids less dense than [[Density of water|water]]. Investigation by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences found major errors in [[salinity]] and temperature controls that had caused serious variations in published values. Hydrometers in the U.S. had been manufactured and distributed widely with a modulus of 141.5 instead of the Baumé scale modulus of 140. The scale was so firmly established that, by 1921, the remedy implemented by the [[American Petroleum Institute]] was to create the API gravity scale, recognizing the scale that was actually being used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sizes.com/units/hydrometer_api.htm API Degree history]&lt;/ref&gt;

==API gravity formulas==
The formula to calculate API gravity from [[Specific Gravity]] (SG) is:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{API gravity} = \frac{141.5}{\text{SG}} - 131.5&lt;/math&gt;

Conversely, the specific gravity of petroleum liquids can be derived from their API gravity value as

:&lt;math&gt;\text{SG at}~60^\circ\text{F} = \frac{141.5}{\text{API gravity} + 131.5}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, a heavy oil with a specific gravity of 1.0 (i.e., with the same density as pure water at 60&amp;nbsp;°F) has an API gravity of:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{141.5}{1.0} - 131.5 = 10.0^\circ{\text{API}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Using API gravity to calculate barrels of crude oil per metric ton==
In the oil industry, quantities of crude oil are often measured in metric [[tonne|ton]]s. One can calculate the approximate number of [[Barrel_(unit)#Oil_barrel|barrels]] per metric ton for a given crude oil based on its API gravity:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{barrels of crude oil per metric ton} = \frac{\text{API gravity}+131.5}{141.5\times 0.159}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, a metric ton of [[West Texas Intermediate]] (39.6° API) has a volume of about 7.6 barrels.

==Measurement of API gravity from its specific gravity==
To derive the API gravity, the specific gravity (i.e., density relative to water) is first measured using either the [[hydrometer]], detailed in [[ASTM]] D1298 or with the [[oscillating U-tube]] method detailed in ASTM D4052.

Density adjustments at different temperatures, corrections for soda-lime glass expansion and contraction and [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] corrections for opaque oils are detailed in the [[Petroleum Measurement Tables]], details of usage specified in ASTM D1250. The specific gravity is defined by the formula below.

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{SG oil} = \frac{\rho_\text{crudeoil}}{\rho_{\text{H}_2\text{O}}}&lt;/math&gt;

With the formula presented in the previous section, the API gravity can be readily calculated. When converting oil density to specific gravity using the above definition, it is important to use the correct density of water, according to the standard conditions used when the measurement was made. The official density of water at 60&amp;nbsp;°F according to the 2008 edition of ASTM D1250 is 999.016&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Report on the Development, Construction, Calculation and Preparation of the ASTM – IP Petroleum Measurement Tables (ASTM D1250; IP 200), 1960, published by the Institute of Petroleum, 61 New Cavendish Street, London, W.1 and American Society for Testing Materials, 1916 Race Street, Philadelphia 3, Pa.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980 value is 999.012&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;API Manual of Petroleum Measurement Standards, Chapter 11.1 – 1980,Volume XI/XII, Adjunct to: ASTM D1250-80 and IP 200/80&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases the standard conditions may be 15&amp;nbsp;°C (59&amp;nbsp;°F) and not 60&amp;nbsp;°F (15.56&amp;nbsp;°C), in which case a different value for the water density would be appropriate (''see'' [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]]).

==Direct Measurement of API gravity (Hydrometer method)==

There are advantages to field testing and on-board conversion of measured volumes to volume correction.
This method is detailed in ASTM D287.

==Classifications or grades==
Generally speaking, oil with an API gravity between 40 and 45° commands the highest prices. Above 45°, the molecular chains become shorter and less valuable to refineries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Comments on Crude Oil Gravity Adjustments |url=http://dnr.louisiana.gov/sec/execdiv/techasmt/oil_gas/crude_oil_gravity/comments_1989.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502160519/http://dnr.louisiana.gov/sec/execdiv/techasmt/oil_gas/crude_oil_gravity/comments_1989.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 May 2006 |publisher=Louisiana Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=6 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crude oil]] is classified as light, medium, or heavy according to its measured API gravity.

* [[Light crude oil]] has an API gravity higher than 31.1° (i.e., less than 870&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
* Medium oil has an API gravity between 22.3 and 31.1° (i.e., 870 to 920&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
* [[Heavy crude oil]] has an API gravity below 22.3° (i.e., 920 to 1000&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
* Extra heavy oil has an API gravity below 10.0° (i.e., greater than 1000&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)

However, not all parties use the same grading.&lt;ref&gt;Crude oil grades, Crudemonitor.ca, web PDF file: [http://www.crudemonitor.ca/quickfacts/misc/grades.pdf CMonitor-Gr-PDF] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008191730/http://www.crudemonitor.ca/quickfacts/misc/grades.pdf |date=October 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Geological Survey]] uses slightly different ranges.&lt;ref&gt;USGS FS2006-3133_508, web PDF file: [http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2006/3133/pdf/FS2006-3133_508.pdf USGS-508-PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crude oil with API gravity less than 10° is referred to as [[extra heavy oil]] or [[bitumen]]. Bitumen derived from [[oil sands]] deposits in Alberta, Canada, has an API gravity of around 8°. It can be diluted with lighter hydrocarbons to produce [[diluted bitumen]], which has an API gravity of less than 22.3°, or further "upgraded" to an API gravity of 31 to 33° as [[synthetic crude]].&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Centre for Energy Information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8117">In [[Reservoir Petrophysics|petrophysics]], '''Archie's law''' relates the in-situ [[electrical conductivity]] of a sedimentary rock to its [[porosity]] and [[brine]] saturation:
 
:&lt;math&gt;C_t = \frac{1}{a} C_w \phi^m S_w^n&lt;/math&gt;
 
Here, &lt;math&gt;\phi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; denotes the porosity, &lt;math&gt;C_t&lt;/math&gt; the electrical conductivity of the fluid saturated rock, &lt;math&gt;C_w&lt;/math&gt; represents the electrical conductivity of the brine, &lt;math&gt;S_w&lt;/math&gt; is the brine [[water saturation|saturation]], &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the cementation exponent of the rock (usually in the range 1.8&amp;ndash;2.0 for sandstones), &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the saturation exponent (usually close to 2) and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[tortuosity]] factor.

Reformulated for [[electrical resistivity]], the equation reads
:&lt;math&gt;R_t = a \phi^{-m} S_w^{-n} R_w &lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;R_t&lt;/math&gt; for the fluid saturated rock resistivity, and &lt;math&gt;R_w&lt;/math&gt; for the brine resistivity.

The factor
:&lt;math&gt;F = \frac{a}{\phi^m} = \frac{R_o}{R_w}&lt;/math&gt;
is also called the '''formation factor''', where &lt;math&gt;R_o&lt;/math&gt; is the resistivity of the rock filled with only water (&lt;math&gt;S_w=1&lt;/math&gt;).

The factor
:&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{R_t}{R_o} = S_w^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;
is also called the '''resistivity index'''.

It is a purely [[empirical law]] attempting to describe [[ion]] flow (mostly [[sodium]] and [[chloride]]) in clean, consolidated sands, with varying intergranular porosity. Electrical conduction is assumed not to be present within the rock grains or in fluids other than water.

Archie's law is named after [[Gus Archie]] (1907&amp;ndash;1978) who developed this empirical quantitative relationship between porosity, electrical conductivity, and brine saturation of rocks. Archie's law laid the foundation for modern [[Well logging|well log]] interpretation as it relates borehole electrical conductivity measurements to [[hydrocarbon]] saturations (which, for fluid saturated rock, equals &lt;math&gt;1 - S_w&lt;/math&gt;).

==Parameters==

===Cementation exponent, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;===

The [[cementation (geology)|cementation]] exponent models how much the pore network increases the resistivity, as the rock itself is assumed to be non-conductive. If the pore network were to be modelled as a set of parallel capillary tubes, a cross-section area average of the rock's resistivity would yield porosity dependence equivalent to a cementation exponent of 1. However, the [[tortuosity]] of the rock increases this to a higher number than 1. This relates the cementation exponent to the [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] of the rock, increasing permeability decreases the cementation exponent.

The exponent &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; has been observed near 1.3 for unconsolidated sands, and is believed to increase with cementation. Common values for this cementation exponent for consolidated sandstones are 1.8 &lt; &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; &lt; 2.0.
In carbonate rocks, the cementation exponent shows higher variance due to strong diagenetic affinity and complex pore structures. Values between 1.7 and 4.1 have been observed.&lt;ref&gt;Verwer, K., Eberli, G.P. and Weger, R.J., 2011, Effect of pore structure on electrical resistivity in carbonates: AAPG Bulletin, no. 20, v. 94, p. 1-16&lt;/ref&gt;

The cementation exponent is usually assumed not to be dependent on [[temperature]].

===Saturation exponent, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;===
The saturation exponent &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; usually is fixed to values close to 2. The [[Water content|saturation]] exponent models the dependency on the presence of non-conductive fluid (hydrocarbons) in the pore-space, and is related to the [[Wetting|wettability]] of the rock. Water-wet rocks will, for low water saturation values, maintain a continuous film along the pore walls making the rock conductive. Oil-wet rocks will have discontinuous droplets of water within the pore space, making the rock less conductive.

===Tortuosity factor, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;===

The constant &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, called the ''tortuosity factor'',  ''cementation intercept'', ''lithology factor'' or, ''[[lithology]] coefficient'' is sometimes used. It is meant to correct for variation in [[Compaction (geology)|compaction]], pore structure and grain size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Winsauer |first=W.O. |author2=Shearing H.M., Jr. |author3=Masson, P.H. |author4=Williams, M. |year=1952 |title=Resistivity of brine saturated sands in relation to pore geometry |journal=AAPG Bulletin |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=253–277 |doi=10.1306/3d9343f4-16b1-11d7-8645000102c1865d}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The parameter a is called the tortuosity factor and clearly is related to the path length of the current flow. The value lies in the range 0.5 to 1.5. a may be different in different reservoirs. However a typical value to start with for a sandstone reservoir might be 0.6, which then can be tuned during log data matching process with other sources of data such as core.

===Measuring the exponents===
&lt;!-- note that "Pickett plot" redirects directly to this section header --&gt;
In petrophysics, the only reliable source for the numerical value of both exponents is experiments on sand plugs from cored wells. The brine conductivity can be measured directly on produced water samples. Alternatively, the brine conductivity and the cementation exponent can also be inferred from downhole electrical conductivity measurements across brine-saturated intervals. For brine-saturated intervals (&lt;math&gt;S_w=1&lt;/math&gt;) Archie's law can be written
 
:&lt;math&gt;\log{C_t} = \log{C_w} + m \log{\phi}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, plotting the logarithm of the measured in-situ electrical conductivity against the logarithm of the measured in-situ porosity ('''Pickett plot'''), according to Archie's law a straight-line relationship is expected with slope equal to the cementation exponent &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and intercept equal to the logarithm of the in-situ brine conductivity.

==Sands with clay/shaly sands==

Archie's law postulates that the rock [[matrix (geology)|matrix]] is non-conductive. For sandstone with [[clay minerals]], this assumption is no longer true in general, due to the clay's structure and [[cation exchange capacity]].  The [[Waxman–Smits equation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=M.H. |last1=Waxman |first2=L.J.M. |last2=Smits |title=Electrical conductivities in oil-bearing shaly sands |journal=SPE Journal |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=107–122 |year=1968 |doi=10.2118/1863-A}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one model that tries to correct for this.

'''Basin modelling''' is the term broadly applied to a group of [[geology|geological]] disciplines that can be used to analyse the formation and evolution of [[sedimentary basin]]s, often but not exclusively to aid evaluation of potential [[hydrocarbon]] reserves.

At its most basic, a basin modelling exercise must assess:

# The burial history of the basin (see [[back-stripping]]).
# The thermal history of the basin (see [[thermal history modelling]]).
# The maturity history of the [[source rock]]s.
# The expulsion, migration and trapping of hydrocarbons.

By doing so, valuable inferences can be made about such matters as hydrocarbon generation and timing, maturity of potential source rocks and migration paths of expelled hydrocarbons.

'''Biomarkers''' are any of a suite of complex organic compounds composed of carbon, hydrogen and other elements such as oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur, which are found in [[Petroleum|crude oils]], bitumens, [[petroleum]] [[source rock]] and eventually show simplification in molecular structure from the parent organic molecules found in all living organisms.  Essentially, they are complex carbon-based molecules derived from formerly living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Z.; Stout, S.; Fingas, M. Environmental Forensics, 2006 7, 105-146.&lt;/ref&gt; Biomarker compounds are typically analyzed using [[gas chromatography]] and [[mass spectrometry]].  Some examples of biomarkers found in petroleum are [[pristane]], [[phytane]], [[sterane]]s, [[Oleanane|triterpanes]] and [[porphyrin]].   Geologists and Geochemists use biomarkers traces found in crude oils and their related [[source rock]] to unravel the stratigraphic  origin and migration pathways of presently existing [[petroleum]] deposits.&lt;ref&gt;Ian M.

This is due to potential hydrocarbon contamination and biodegradation in the rock samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ratnayake|first=Amila Sandaruwan|last2=Sampei|first2=Yoshikazu|date=2019-06-01|title=Organic geochemical evaluation of contamination tracers in deepwater well rock cuttings from the Mannar Basin, Sri Lanka|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s13202-018-0575-8|journal=Journal of Petroleum Exploration and Production Technology|language=en|volume=9|issue=2|pages=989–996|doi=10.1007/s13202-018-0575-8|issn=2190-0566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''blowout''' is the uncontrolled release of [[crude oil]] and/or [[natural gas]] from an [[oil well]] or [[gas well]] after pressure control systems have failed.&lt;ref name="Allabout"&gt;'All About Blowout', R. Westergaard, Norwegian Oil Review, 1987 {{ISBN|82-991533-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern wells have [[blowout preventer]]s intended to prevent such an occurrence. An accidental spark during a blowout can lead to a catastrophic [[oil well fire|oil or gas fire]].

Prior to the advent of pressure control equipment in the 1920s, the uncontrolled release of oil and gas from a well while drilling was common and was known as an '''oil gusher''', '''gusher''' or '''wild well'''.

== History ==
Gushers were an icon of [[oil exploration]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During that era, the simple drilling techniques such as [[drilling rig#Cable tool drilling|cable-tool drilling]] and the lack of [[blowout preventer]]s meant that drillers could not control high-pressure reservoirs. When these high pressure zones were breached, the oil or natural gas would travel up the well at a high rate, forcing out the drill string and creating a gusher. A well which began as a gusher was said to have "blown&amp;nbsp;in": for instance, the [[Lakeview Gusher]] ''blew&amp;nbsp;in'' in 1910. These uncapped wells could produce large amounts of oil, often shooting 200&amp;nbsp;feet (60&amp;nbsp;m) or higher into the air.&lt;ref name="sjgs.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sjgs.com/lakeview.html |title=www.sjgs.com |publisher=www.sjgs.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019100520/http://www.sjgs.com/lakeview.html |archivedate=2006-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A blowout primarily composed of natural gas was known as a ''gas&amp;nbsp;gusher''.

Despite being symbols of new-found wealth, gushers were dangerous and wasteful.  They killed workmen involved in drilling, destroyed equipment, and coated the landscape with thousands of [[Oil barrel|barrels]] of oil; additionally, the explosive concussion released by the well when it pierces an oil/gas reservoir has been responsible for a number of oilmen losing their hearing entirely;  standing too near to the drilling rig at the moment it drills into the oil reservoir is extremely hazardous.  The impact on wildlife is very hard to quantify, but can only be estimated to be mild in the most optimistic models—realistically, the ecological impact is estimated by scientists across the ideological spectrum to be severe, profound, and lasting.&lt;ref name="duration"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1990171,00.html |title=Gulf Oil Spill: Scientists Escalate Environmental Warnings |accessdate=June 30, 2010 |work=Time |first=Bryan |last=Walsh |date=2010-05-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629041941/http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1990171,00.html |archivedate=June 29, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To complicate matters further, the free flowing oil was—and is—in danger of igniting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~txnavarr/business/oil_industry/hughes_and_mckie_oil_well_fire/index.htm |title=Hughes McKie Oil Well Explosion |publisher=Rootsweb.com |date=1923-05-08 |accessdate=2016-01-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225221428/http://www.rootsweb.com/~txnavarr/business/oil_industry/hughes_and_mckie_oil_well_fire/index.htm |archivedate=2008-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One dramatic account of a blowout and fire reads,

&lt;blockquote&gt;With a roar like a hundred express trains racing across the countryside, the well blew out, spewing oil in all directions. The derrick simply evaporated. Casings wilted like lettuce out of water, as heavy machinery writhed and twisted into grotesque shapes in the blazing inferno.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aoghs.org/technology/end-of-gushers/ |title=Ending Oil Gushers - BOP &amp;#124; |publisher=Aoghs.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160131233652/http://aoghs.org/technology/end-of-gushers/ |archivedate=2016-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The development of rotary drilling techniques where the density of the [[drilling fluid]] is sufficient to overcome the downhole pressure of a newly penetrated zone meant that gushers became avoidable. If however the fluid density was not adequate or fluids were lost to the formation, then there was still a significant risk of a well blowout.

In 1924 the first successful [[blowout preventer]] was brought to market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asme.org/Communities/History/Landmarks/First_RamType_Blowout.cfm |title=Engineering History |publisher=Asme.org |date=1905-03-10 |accessdate=2016-01-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226061733/http://www.asme.org/Communities/History/Landmarks/First_RamType_Blowout.cfm |archivedate=2010-12-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BOP valve affixed to the [[wellhead]] could be closed in the event of drilling into a high pressure zone, and the well fluids contained. [[Well control]] techniques could be used to regain control of the well.  As the technology developed, blowout preventers became standard equipment, and gushers became a thing of the past.

In the modern petroleum industry, uncontrollable wells became known as blowouts and are comparatively rare.  There has been significant improvement in technology, well control techniques, and personnel training which has helped to prevent their occurring.&lt;ref name="Allabout"/&gt; From 1976 to 1981, 21 blowout reports are available.&lt;ref name="Allabout"/&gt;

=== Notable gushers ===
#The earliest known oil gusher, in 1815, actually resulted from an attempt to drill for salt, not for oil. Joseph Eichar and his team were digging west of the town of Wooster, Ohio, along Killbuck Creek, when they struck oil. In a written retelling by Eichar's daughter, Eleanor, the strike produced "a spontaneous outburst, which shot up high as the tops of the highest trees!"&lt;ref name="1815_gusher"&gt;{{cite book

#Oil drillers struck a number of gushers near [[Oil City, Pennsylvania]] in 1861. The most famous was the '''Little &amp; Merrick well''', which began gushing oil on 17 April 1861. The spectacle of the fountain of oil flowing out at about {{convert|3000|oilbbl|m3}} per day had drawn about 150 spectators by the time an hour later when the oil gusher burst into flames, raining fire down on the oil-soaked onlookers. Thirty people died. Other early gushers in northwest Pennsylvania were the '''Phillips #2''' ({{convert|4000|oilbbl|m3}} per day) in September 1861, and the '''Woodford well''' ({{convert|3000|oilbbl|m3}} per day) in December 1861.&lt;ref&gt;''The Derrick's Hand-Book of Petroleum'' (Oil City, Penn.: Derrick Publishing, 1898) 20–24.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#The '''Shaw Gusher''' in [[Oil Springs, Ontario]], was Canada's first oil gusher. On January 16, 1862, it shot oil from over {{convert|60|m}} below ground to above the treetops at a rate of {{convert|3000|oilbbl|m3}} per day, triggering the oil boom in Lambton County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oilsprings.ca/todo.htm |title=The Shaw Gusher |publisher=The Village of Oil Springs |accessdate=2011-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206005118/http://www.oilsprings.ca/todo.htm |archivedate=2009-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

#One of the most troublesome gushers happened on June 23, 1985 at well #37 at the [[Tengiz field]] in [[Atyrau]], [[Kazakh SSR]], [[Soviet Union]], where the 4209-metre deep well blew out and the 200-metre high gusher self-ignited two days later. Oil pressure up to 800 [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]] and high [[hydrogen sulfide]] content had led to the gusher being capped only on 27 July 1986.

==Cause of blowouts==

===Reservoir pressure===
{{See also|Petroleum#Formation|l1=Petroleum formation}}
[[Image:OilReservoir.png|right|thumb|300px|A petroleum trap. An irregularity (the ''trap'') in a layer of impermeable rocks (the ''seal'') retains upward-flowing petroleum, forming a reservoir.]]
[[Petroleum]] or crude oil is a naturally occurring, flammable liquid consisting of a complex mixture of [[hydrocarbons]] of various molecular weights, and other organic compounds, that are found in [[geologic formation]]s beneath the Earth's surface. Because most hydrocarbons are lighter than rock or water, they often migrate upward and occasionally laterally through adjacent rock layers until either reaching the surface or becoming trapped within porous rocks (known as reservoirs) by impermeable rocks above. When hydrocarbons are concentrated in a trap, an oil field forms, from which the liquid can be extracted by drilling and pumping. The down hole pressure in the rock structures changes depending upon the depth and the characteristic of the [[source rock]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} [[Natural gas]] (mostly [[methane]]) may be present also, usually above the oil within the reservoir, but sometimes dissolved in the oil at reservoir pressure and temperature.  This dissolved gas often evolves as free gas as the pressure is reduced either under controlled production operations or in a kick or in an uncontrolled blowout.  The hydrocarbon in some reservoirs may be essentially all natural gas.

===Formation kick===
The downhole fluid pressures are controlled in modern wells through the balancing of the [[hydrostatic pressure]] provided by the [[Drilling fluid|mud]] column. Should the balance of the drilling mud pressure be incorrect (i.e., the mud pressure gradient is less than the formation pore pressure gradient), then formation fluids (oil, natural gas and/or water) can begin to flow into the wellbore and up the annulus (the space between the outside of the [[drill string]] and the wall of the open hole or the inside of the [[casing (borehole)|casing]]), and/or inside the [[drill pipe]]. This is commonly called a ''kick''. Ideally, mechanical barriers such as [[blowout preventer]]s (BOPs) can be closed to isolate the well while the hydrostatic balance is regained through circulation of fluids in the well. But if the well is not shut in (common term for the closing of the blow-out preventer), a kick can quickly escalate into a blowout when the formation fluids reach the surface, especially when the influx contains gas that expands rapidly with the reduced pressure as it flows up the wellbore, further decreasing the effective weight of the fluid.

Early warning signs of an impending well kick while drilling are:
* Sudden change in drilling rate;
* Reduction in drillpipe weight;
* Change in pump pressure;
* Change in drilling fluid return rate.

Other warning signs during the drilling operation are:
* Returning mud "cut" by (i.e., contaminated by) gas, oil or water;
* Connection gases, high background gas units, and high bottoms-up gas units detected in the mudlogging unit.&lt;ref&gt;Grace, R: ''Blowout and Well Control Handbook'', page 42.  Gulf Professional Publishing, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary means of detecting a kick while drilling is a relative change in the circulation rate back up to the surface into the mud pits. The drilling crew or mud engineer keeps track of the level in the mud pits and/or closely monitors the rate of mud returns versus the rate that is being pumped down the drill pipe. Upon encountering a zone of higher pressure than is being exerted by the hydrostatic head of the drilling mud (including the small additional frictional head while circulating) at the bit, an increase in mud return rate would be noticed as the formation fluid influx blends in with the circulating drilling mud.  Conversely, if the rate of returns is slower than expected, it means that a certain amount of the mud is being lost to a thief zone somewhere below the last [[casing shoe]]. This does not necessarily result in a kick (and may never become one); however, a drop in the mud level might allow influx of formation fluids from other zones if the hydrostatic head at is reduced to less than that of a full column of mud.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Well control===
The first response to detecting a kick would be to isolate the wellbore from the surface by activating the blow-out preventers and closing in the well. Then the drilling crew would attempt to circulate in a heavier ''kill fluid'' to increase the hydrostatic pressure (sometimes with the assistance of a [[well control]] company). In the process, the influx fluids will be slowly circulated out in a controlled manner, taking care not to allow any gas to accelerate up the wellbore too quickly by controlling casing pressure with chokes on a predetermined schedule.

This effect will be minor if the influx fluid is mainly salt water. And with an oil-based drilling fluid it can be masked in the early stages of controlling a kick because gas influx may dissolve into the oil under pressure at depth, only to come out of solution and expand rather rapidly as the influx nears the surface. Once all the contaminant has been circulated out, the shut-in casing pressure should have reached zero.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Capping stacks are used for controlling blowouts.  The cap is an open valve that is closed after bolted on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jwco.com/technical-litterature/p10.htm |title=Blowout Control, Part 10 – Surface Intervention Methods |publisher=Jwco.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203170305/http://www.jwco.com/technical-litterature/p10.htm |archivedate=2016-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of blowouts==
[[File:IXTOC I oil well blowout.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ixtoc I]] oil well blowout]]
Well blowouts can occur during the drilling phase, during [[Well test (oil and gas)|well testing]], during well [[Completion (oil and gas wells)|completion]], during production, or during [[workover]] activities.&lt;ref name="Allabout"/&gt;

===Surface blowouts===
Blowouts can eject the [[drill string]] out of the well, and the force of the escaping fluid can be strong enough to damage the [[drilling rig]]. In addition to oil, the output of a well blowout might include natural gas, water, drilling fluid, mud, sand, rocks, and other substances.

Blowouts will often be ignited from sparks from rocks being ejected, or simply from heat generated by friction. A well control company then will need to extinguish the well fire or cap the well, and replace the casing head and other surface equipment. If the flowing gas contains poisonous [[hydrogen sulfide]], the oil operator might decide to ignite the stream to convert this to less hazardous substances.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Sometimes blowouts can be so forceful that they cannot be directly brought under control from the surface, particularly if there is so much energy in the flowing zone that it does not deplete significantly over time. In such cases, other wells (called [[relief well]]s) may be drilled to intersect the well or pocket, in order to allow kill-weight fluids to be introduced at depth. When first drilled in the 1930s relief wells were drilled to inject water into the main drill well hole.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LeADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA86 "Wild Oil Well Tamed by Scientific Trick" ''Popular Mechanics'', July 1934] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503160212/https://books.google.com/books?id=LeADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA86 |date=2018-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to what might be inferred from the term, such wells generally are not used to help relieve pressure using multiple outlets from the blowout zone.

===Subsea blowouts===
[[Image:Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling unit on fire 2010.jpg|right|thumb|[[Deepwater Horizon explosion|Macondo-1 well blowout on the Deepwater Horizon rig]], 21 April 2010]]
The two main causes of a subsea blowout are equipment failures and imbalances with encountered subsurface reservoir pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Does Subsea Well Containment and Incident Response Work?|url=http://www.rigzone.com/training/insight.asp?i_id=360|website=Rigzone|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418011815/http://www.rigzone.com/training/insight.asp?i_id=360|archivedate=2015-04-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Subsea]] wells have pressure control equipment located on the seabed or between the riser pipe and drilling platform. [[Blowout preventer]]s (BOPs) are the primary safety devices designed to maintain control of geologically driven well pressures. They contain hydraulic-powered cut-off mechanisms to stop the flow of hydrocarbons in the event of a loss of well control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drilling Blowout Preventers|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/oilandgas/drilling/wellcontrol_bop.html|publisher=United States Department of Labor|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630005923/https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/oilandgas/drilling/wellcontrol_bop.html|archivedate=2015-06-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with blowout prevention equipment and processes in place, operators must be prepared to respond to a blowout should one occur. Before drilling a well, a detailed well construction design plan, an Oil Spill Response Plan as well as a Well Containment Plan must be submitted, reviewed and approved by BSEE and is contingent upon access to adequate well containment resources in accordance to NTL 2010-N10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NTL No. 2010-N10 |url=http://www.bsee.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Notices-to-Lessees/2010/10-n10/ |website=BSEE.gov |publisher=US Department of the Interior Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930171506/http://www.bsee.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Notices-to-Lessees/2010/10-n10/ |archivedate=2015-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|Deepwater Horizon well blowout]] in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010 occurred at a {{convert|5000|ft|m}} water depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Macondo Prospect, Gulf of Mexico, United States of America|url=http://www.offshore-technology.com/projects/macondoprospect/|website=Offshore Technology|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426211713/http://www.offshore-technology.com/projects/macondoprospect/|archivedate=2012-04-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current blowout response capabilities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico meet capture and process rates of 130,000 barrels of fluid per day and a gas handling capacity of 220 million cubic feet per day at depths through 10,000 feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HWCG Expands Capabilities to Minimize Potential Impact of a Deepwater Incident|url=http://www.hwcg.org/pressreleases/2015/3/12/hwcg-expands-capabilities-to-minimize-potential-impact-of-a-deepwater-incident|website=HWCG.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081507/http://www.hwcg.org/pressreleases/2015/3/12/hwcg-expands-capabilities-to-minimize-potential-impact-of-a-deepwater-incident|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Underground blowouts===
An underground blowout is a special situation where fluids from high pressure zones flow uncontrolled to lower pressure zones within the wellbore.  Usually this is from deeper higher pressure zones to shallower lower pressure formations. There may be no escaping fluid flow at the wellhead. However, the formation(s) receiving the influx can become overpressured, a possibility that future drilling plans in the vicinity must consider.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Blowout control companies==
[[Myron M. Kinley]] was a pioneer in fighting oil well fires and blowouts. He developed many patents and designs for the tools and techniques of oil firefighting. His father, Karl T. Kinley, attempted to extinguish an oil well fire with the help of a massive explosion—a method that remains a common technique for fighting oil fires. The first oil well put out with explosives by Myron Kinley and his father, was in 1913.&lt;ref name="Boots"&gt;Boots &amp; Coots History Page : {{cite web |url=http://www.boots-coots.com/members/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526031912/http://www.boots-coots.com/members/history.html |archivedate=2010-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinley would later form the M.M. Kinley Company in 1923.&lt;ref name="Boots" /&gt; Asger "Boots" Hansen and Edward Owen "Coots" Matthews also begin their careers under Kinley.

[[Red Adair|Paul N. "Red" Adair]] joined the M.M. Kinley Company in 1946, and worked 14 years with Myron Kinley before starting his own company, Red Adair Co., Inc., in 1959.

Red Adair Co. has helped in controlling offshore blowouts, including:
* [[CATCO fire]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in 1959
* "The [[Devil's Cigarette Lighter]]" in 1962 in [[Gassi Touil]], Algeria, in the [[Sahara Desert]]
* The [[Ixtoc I oil spill]] in Mexico's [[Bay of Campeche]] in 1979
* The [[Piper Alpha]] disaster in the [[North Sea]] in 1988
* The [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] following the [[Gulf War]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redadair.com/hisstory.html|title=redadair.com|author=|date=|website=www.redadair.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080717184126/http://www.redadair.com/hisstory.html|archivedate=17 July 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1968 American film, ''[[Hellfighters (film)|Hellfighters]]'', which starred John Wayne, is about a group of oil well firefighters, based loosely on the life of Adair, who served as a technical advisor on the film, along with his associates, "Boots" Hansen, and "Coots" Matthews.

In 1994, Adair retired and sold his company to Global Industries. Management of Adair's company left and created [[International Well Control]] (IWC). In 1997, they would buy the company [[Boots &amp; Coots|Boots &amp; Coots International Well Control, Inc.]], which was founded by Hansen and Matthews in 1978.

==Methods of quenching blowouts==

===Subsea Well Containment===
[[File:Figure 2- Subsea Well Containment Response Equipment (7045774079) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Government Accountability Office]] diagram showing subsea well containment operations]]
After the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|Macondo-1 blowout on the Deepwater Horizon]], the offshore industry collaborated with government regulators to develop a framework to respond to future subsea incidents. As a result, all energy companies operating in the deep-water U.S. Gulf of Mexico must submit an OPA 90 required Oil Spill Response Plan with the addition of a Regional Containment Demonstration Plan prior to any drilling activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidance to Owners and Operators of Offshore Facilities Seaward of the Coast Line Concerning Regional Oil Spill Response Plans (NTL No. 2012-N06)|url=http://www.bsee.gov/uploadedFiles/BSEE/Regulations_and_Guidance/Notices_to_Lessees/2012/NTL2012-N06.pdf|website=BSEE.gov|publisher=Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305004013/http://www.bsee.gov/uploadedFiles/BSEE/Regulations_and_Guidance/Notices_to_Lessees/2012/NTL2012-N06.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event of a subsea blowout, these plans are immediately activated, drawing on some of the equipment and processes effectively used to contain the Deepwater Horizon well as well as others that have been developed in its aftermath.

In order to regain control of a subsea well, the Responsible Party would first secure the safety of all personnel on board the rig and then begin a detailed evaluation of the incident site. [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s (ROVs) would be dispatched to inspect the condition of the wellhead, [[Blowout Preventer]] (BOP) and other subsea well equipment. The debris removal process would begin immediately to provide clear access for a capping stack.

Once lowered and latched on the wellhead, a capping stack uses stored hydraulic pressure to close a hydraulic ram and stop the flow of hydrocarbons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Madrid|first1=Mauricio|last2=Matson|first2=Anthony|title=How Offshore Capping Stacks Work|journal=Society of Petroleum Engineers: The Way Ahead|date=2014|volume=10|issue=1|url=http://www.spe.org/twa/print/archives/2014/2014v10n1/13_Tech101_v10n1.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151129101843/http://www.spe.org/twa/print/archives/2014/2014v10n1/13_Tech101_v10n1.pdf|archivedate=2015-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If shutting in the well could introduce unstable geological conditions in the wellbore, a cap and flow procedure would be used to contain hydrocarbons and safely transport them to a surface vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Does Subsea Well Containment and Incident Response Work?|url=http://www.rigzone.com/training/insight.asp?insight_id=360&amp;c_id=17|website=Rigzone.com|publisher=Rigzone|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909215623/http://www.rigzone.com/training/insight.asp?insight_id=360&amp;c_id=17|archivedate=2015-09-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Responsible Party works in collaboration with [[Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement|BSEE]] and the [[United States Coast Guard]] to oversee response efforts, including source control, recovering discharged oil and mitigating environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memoranda of Agreement Between the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement and U.S. Coast Guard (MOA: OCS-03)|url=http://www.bsee.gov/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=85899347659|publisher=BSEE/USCG|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425065259/http://www.bsee.gov/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=85899347659|archivedate=2015-04-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several not-for-profit organizations provide a solution to effectively contain a subsea blowout. [[HWCG LLC]] and [[Marine Well Containment Company]] operate within the U.S. Gulf of Mexico&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deepwater Horizon Spurs Development of Spill Prevention Systems|url=http://www.rigzone.com/news/oil_gas/a/106319/Deepwater_Horizon_Spurs_Development_of_Spill_Prevention_Systems|publisher=Rigzone|date=April 20, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908051133/http://www.rigzone.com/news/oil_gas/a/106319/Deepwater_Horizon_Spurs_Development_of_Spill_Prevention_Systems|archivedate=September 8, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; waters, while cooperatives like Oil Spill Response Limited offer support for international operations.

===Use of nuclear explosions===
On Sep. 30, 1966 the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Urta-Bulak]], an area about 80 kilometers from [[Bukhara]], [[Uzbekistan]], experienced blowouts on five natural gas wells.  It was claimed in Komsomoloskaya Pravda that after years of burning uncontrollably they were able to stop them entirely.&lt;ref name="pravda-nuke"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://www.kp.ru/daily/24482/640124/&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=&amp;ie=UTF-8|title=Google Translate|author=|date=|website=translate.google.com|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Soviets lowered a specially made 30 kiloton nuclear bomb into a {{convert|6|km|ft}} borehole drilled {{convert|25|to|50|m|ft}} away from the original (rapidly leaking) well.  A nuclear explosive was deemed necessary because conventional explosive both lacked the necessary power and would also require a great deal more space underground.  When the bomb was set off, it crushed the original pipe that was carrying the gas from the deep reservoir to the surface and glassified all the surrounding rock.  This caused the leak and fire at the surface to cease within approximately one minute of the explosion, and proved over the years to have been a permanent solution.   A second attempt on a similar well was not as successful and other tests were for such experiments as oil extraction enhancement (Stavropol, 1969) and the creation of gas storage reservoirs (Orenburg, 1970).&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpPNQoTlacU|title=An Atomic Bomb will stop the Gulf Oil Leak, LOOK!|first=|last=CineGraphic|date=4 July 2009|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2018|via=YouTube|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107094802/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpPNQoTlacU|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Borehole imaging logs''' are logging and [[Data processing|data-processing]] methods used to produce [[Two-dimensional space|two-dimensional]], centimeter-scale images of a borehole wall and the rocks that make it up .These tools are limited to the open-hole environment. The applications where images are useful cover the full range the exploration and production (E&amp;P) cycle from exploration through appraisal, development, and production to abandonment.
 
Specific applications are sedimentology, structural geology/tectonics, reservoir geomechanics and drilling, [[reservoir engineering]].

The tools can be categorized a number of ways: energy source (electrical, acoustic, or nuclear); [[Conveyancing|conveyance]] (wireline or logging while drilling (LWD)); and mud type (water-based mud (WMD) or oil-based mud (OBM)).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2035">{{Well logging}}
A '''caliper log''' is a [[well logging]] tool that provides a continuous measurement of the size and shape of a [[borehole]] along its depth&lt;ref&gt; Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=caliper%20log&lt;/ref&gt; and is commonly used in [[hydrocarbon exploration]] when drilling wells.  The measurements that are recorded can be an important indicator of cave ins or [[shale]] swelling in the borehole, which can affect the results of other well logs.

==Process==
The caliper tool measures the variation in borehole diameter as it is withdrawn from the bottom of the hole, using two or more articulated arms that push against the borehole wall.  Each arm is typically connected to a [[potentiometer]] which causes the resistance to change as the [[diameter]] of the borehole changes, creating a varying electrical signal that represents the changing shape of the borehole.  This variation in output is translated into changes of diameter after a simple calibration and the caliper log is printed as a continuous series of values of hole diameter with depth.

==Accuracy==
Known challenges with caliper logging include [[borehole spiralling]]. The position of the [[drill bit]] may precess as it drills, leading to spiraling shapes in the wellbore wall, as if the hole had been drilled by a [[screw]]. If the arms of the caliper log follow the grooves of the spiral, it will report too high an average diameter. Moving in and out of the grooves, the caliper will give erratic or periodically varying readings.

In most cases, the borehole's circumference will not be a perfect circle and therefore a caliper tool with several arms is required to obtain a true understanding of the size and shape of the borehole.  The borehole can change to an oval shape after drilling, which can cause the caliper log to overestimate the size of the borehole if its arms get stuck axis.

A '''cement bond log''' documents the evaluation of the integrity of [[cement]] work performed on an [[oil well]].&lt;ref name="OilfieldGlossary1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=cement%20bond%20log|title=cement bond log|accessdate=2008-12-18|publisher=Schlumberger Limited|work=Oilfield Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process of drilling and completing a well, cement is injected through the [[wellbore]] and rises up the [[Annulus (well)|annulus]] between the steel [[Casing (borehole)|casing]] and the [[Geological formation|formation]].&lt;ref name="OilfieldGlossary2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=casing|title=casing|accessdate=2008-12-18|publisher=Schlumberger Limited|work=Oilfield Glossary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sonic tool is typically run on [[wireline (cabling)|wireline]] by a service company that detects the bond of the cement to the casing and formation via a principle based on [[resonance]]. Casing that is not bound has a higher resonant vibration than that which is bound, causing the imparted energy from the sonic signal to be transferred to the formation.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} In this sense, the [[amplitude]] of the [[waveform]] received is the basic measurement that is evaluated.

The data is collected by the tool and recorded on a log which is used by the oil producing company as an indicator of [[zonal isolation]] in the well. There are production reasons and legal reasons (governed by a petroleum regulatory body in each individual state) that dictate the well must have specific areas of isolation.{{Fact|date=December 2008}}

The '''Chalk Group''' (often just called '''the Chalk''') is the [[lithostratigraphy|lithostratigraphic unit]] (a certain number of [[Stratum|rock strata]]) which contains the [[Late Cretaceous]] [[limestone]] succession in southern and eastern England. The same or similar rock sequences occur across the wider northwest [[Europe]]an chalk '[[Physiographic province|province]]'. It is characterised by thick deposits of [[chalk]], a soft [[Porosity|porous]] white limestone, deposited in a marine environment.

Chalk is a limestone that consists of [[coccolith]] biomicrite.&lt;ref&gt;As discussed in [http://www.geologyshop.co.uk/chalk.htm Chalk Facts] by C. S. Harris and Scholle ''et al.'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; A biomicrite is a limestone composed of [[fossil]] debris ("bio") and [[calcium carbonate]] mud ("[[micrite]]"). Most of the fossil debris in chalk consists of the microscopic plates, which are called coccoliths, of microscopic green algae known as [[coccolithophore]]s. In addition to the coccoliths, the fossil debris includes a variable, but minor, percentage of the fragments of [[foraminifera]], [[ostracod]]s and [[Mollusca|mollusks]]. The coccolithophores lived in the upper part of the water column. When they died, the microscopic calcium carbonate plates, which formed their shells settled downward through the ocean water and accumulated on the ocean bottom to form a thick layer of [[calcareous]] [[pelagic sediment|ooze]], which eventually became the Chalk Group.

The Chalk Group usually shows few signs of bedding, other than lines of [[flint]] nodules which become common in the upper part. [[Nodule (geology)|Nodules]] of the mineral [[pyrite]] also occur and are usually [[Redox|oxidized]] to brown [[iron oxide]] on exposed surfaces.

Well-known outcrops include the [[White Cliffs of Dover]], [[Beachy Head]], the southern coastal cliffs of the [[Isle of Wight]] and the [[quarry|quarries]] and motorway cuttings at [[Blue Bell Hill]], [[Kent]], (which has been classified as a ''[[Site of Special Scientific Interest]]'') and at the [[Stokenchurch Gap]] on the [[Oxfordshire]]/[[Buckinghamshire]] border where the [[M40 motorway]] cuts through the [[Aston Rowant National Nature Reserve]].

==Subdivisions==
The Chalk Group is now divided into a ''White Chalk Subgroup'' and a ''Grey Chalk Subgroup'', both of which are further subdivided into [[Geological formation|formations]]. These modern divisions replace numerous earlier divisions, references to which occur widely on geological maps and in other geological literature. Previously no subgroups were defined but three formations were identified; the Upper Chalk, Middle Chalk and Lower Chalk. Different formations are defined within the 'northern' and 'southern' provinces, from Norfolk northwards and south of the Thames valley respectively. A 'transitional province' between the two and covering much of [[East Anglia]] and the [[Chiltern Hills]] is also recognised. A different approach again is taken as regards the succession beneath the [[North Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Hopson, P.M., 2005 ''A Stratigraphical Framework for the Upper Cretaceous Chalk of England and Scotland with Statements on the Chalk of Northern Ireland and the UK Offshore Sector'', British Geological Survey Research Report RR/05/01 (downloaded from www.bgs.ac.uk)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grey Chalk Subgroup===
The Grey Chalk Subgroup (formerly the Lower Chalk minus the Plenus Marls) is usually relatively soft and greyish in colour.  It is also the most fossiliferous (especially for [[Ammonoidea|ammonite]] fossils). The [[stratum|strata]] of this subgroup usually begin with the 'Glauconitic Marl Member' (formerly known as the Glauconitic or Chloritic Marl), named after the grains of the green [[mineral]]s [[glauconite]] and [[Chlorite group|chlorite]] which it contains. The remainder of the subgroup is [[argillaceous minerals|argillaceous]] in its lower part (the West Melbury Marly Chalk Formation (formerly the 'Chalk Marl') and becomes progressively purer in the 'Zig-zag Chalk Formation' (the former 'Grey Chalk'). In the central [[Chiltern Hills|Chilterns]] the two parts are separated by the hard [[Totternhoe Stone]], which forms a prominent scarp in some places. There are few, if any, flint nodules present.

These two formations are not recognised within the northern province i.e. the outcrop north from [[East Anglia]] to [[Yorkshire]], where the entire sequence is now referred to as the 'Ferriby Chalk Formation'. The thickness of the Grey Chalk Subgroup strata varies, averaging around {{convert|200|ft|abbr=on}}, depending upon the location. They often contains fossils such as the ammonites ''[[Schloenbachia]]'', ''[[Scaphites]]'', and ''Mantelliceras'', the [[Belemnoidea|belemnite]] ''[[Actinocamax]]'', and the [[Bivalvia|bivalves]] ''[[Inoceramus]]'' and ''[[Ostrea]]''.

Location: [[Lulworth Cove]], near [[West Lulworth]], [[Dorset]], England.]]

===White Chalk Subgroup===
The White Chalk Subgroup includes what were formerly designated the Middle Chalk and Upper Chalk Formations, together with the Plenus Marls (topmost part of the former Lower Chalk Formation). In the southern province it is divided in the following way (youngest/uppermost at top):
* Portsdown Chalk Formation (formerly part of 'Upper Chalk' and the equivalent of Rowe Chalk Formation, below)
* Culver Chalk Formation (formerly part of 'Upper Chalk')
** Spetisbury Chalk Member (formerly part of 'Upper Chalk')
** Tarrant Chalk Member (formerly part of 'Upper Chalk')
* Newhaven Chalk Formation (formerly part of 'Upper Chalk')
* Seaford Chalk Formation (formerly part of 'Upper Chalk')
* Lewes Nodular Chalk Formation (formerly part of 'Upper Chalk')
* New Pit Chalk Formation (formerly part of 'Middle Chalk')
* Holywell Nodular Chalk Formation (formerly part of 'Middle Chalk')
** Plenus Marls Member

In the northern province the sequence is divided thus:
* Rowe Chalk Formation (formerly part of 'Upper Chalk' and the equivalent of Portsdown Chalk Formation, above)
* Flamborough Chalk Formation (formerly part of 'Upper Chalk')
* Burnham Chalk Formation (formerly part of 'Upper Chalk')
* Welton Chalk Formation (formerly 'Middle Chalk')
** Plenus Marls Member

In the southern province, the former Middle Chalk, now the Holywell Nodular Chalk Formation and overlying New Pit Formation, averages about {{convert|200|ft|abbr=on}} in thickness. The sparse fossils found in this sequence include the [[brachiopod]] ''[[Terebratulina gracilis|Terebratulina]]'' and the [[Sea urchin|echinoid]] ''[[Conulus]]''.

The former Upper Chalk by comparison is softer than the underlying sequence and the flint nodules it contains are far more abundant in the [[Southern England|South of England]], although in [[Yorkshire]] the underlying strata have the highest concentration of flints. It may contain ammonite and [[Gastropoda|gastropod]] fossils in some nodular layers. The thickness of this sequence varies greatly, often averaging around {{convert|300|ft|abbr=on}}. Fossils may be abundant and include the [[Bivalvia|bivalve]] ''[[Spondylus]]'', the [[brachiopod]]s ''Terebratulina'' and ''Gibbithyris'', the [[Sea urchin|echinoids]] ''Sternotaxis'', ''[[Micraster]]'', ''[[Echinocorys]]'', and ''[[Tylocidaris]]'', the [[crinoid]] ''[[Marsupites]]'', and the small [[sponge]] ''Porosphaera''.{{clarifyme|Is this supposed to be ''Porosphaera globularis''? Porosphaera is a fungus. See http://www.cretaceous.de/Porosphaera.html|date=March 2018}}

The youngest beds of the sequence are found on the coast of [[Norfolk]]. Other fossils commonly found in this formation include: solitary [[coral]]s (such as ''Parasmilia''), [[Polychaete|marine worm]] tubes (such as ''[[Rotularia]]''), [[Bryozoa|bryozoans]], scattered fragments of [[starfish]] and fish remains (including [[shark]] teeth such as ''[[Cretolamna]]'' and ''[[Squalicorax]]'').

== Chalk landscapes of England ==
[[File:KentGeologyWealdenDomeSimple.svg|thumb|alt=Cross-sectional diagram of eroded layers of geological anticline with locations of towns indicated|400px|The [[Weald]]en [[Anticline]].]]
The Chalk outcrops across large parts of southern and eastern England and forms a significant number of the major physiographical features. Whilst it has been postulated that a chalk cover was laid down across just about all of England and Wales during [[Cretaceous]] times, subsequent uplift and erosion has resulted in it remaining only southeast of a line drawn roughly between [[The Wash]] and [[Lyme Bay]] in [[Dorset]] and eastwards from the [[escarpment|scarp]]s of the [[Lincolnshire Wolds|Lincolnshire]] and [[Yorkshire Wolds]]. Gentle [[Fold (geology)|folding]] of the [[Mesozoic]] rocks of this region during the [[Alpine orogeny]] has produced the [[London Basin]] and the [[Weald–Artois Anticline]], the [[Hampshire Basin]] and the less gentle [[Purbeck Monocline|Purbeck-Wight monocline]].

The broadly western margin of the Chalk outcrop is marked, from northeast to southwest,  to south by the Chalk downlands of the Yorkshire Wolds, the Lincolnshire Wolds, a subdued feature through western [[Norfolk]], including [[Breckland]], the [[Chiltern Hills]], the [[Berkshire Downs]], [[North Wessex Downs|Marlborough Downs]] and the western margins of [[Salisbury Plain]] and [[Cranborne Chase]] and  the [[Dorset Downs|North and South Dorset Downs]].&lt;ref&gt;Ordnance Survey 1:625,000 scale Physical Map of Great Britain sheet 2&lt;/ref&gt; In parts of the Thames Basin and eastern East Anglia the Chalk is concealed by later deposits, as is the case too within the Hampshire Basin.

[[File:Ivinghoe Beacon seen from The Ridgeway.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ivinghoe Beacon]], Chiltern Hills]]

Only where the Weald–Artois Anticline has been 'unroofed' by erosion i.e. within the [[Weald]] is the Chalk entirely absent. In this area the long south-facing scarp of the [[North Downs]] and the longer north-facing scarp of the [[South Downs]] face one another across the Weald. For similar reasons, the Chalk is largely absent from the rather smaller area to the south of the Purbeck-Wight Monocline, save for [[St Boniface Down|the downs]] immediately north of [[Ventnor]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].

Some of the best exposures of the Chalk are where these ranges intersect the coast to produce dramatic, often vertical cliffs as at [[Flamborough Head]], the [[White Cliffs of Dover]], [[Seven Sisters, Sussex|Seven Sisters]], [[Old Harry Rocks]] (Purbeck) and [[The Needles]] on the [[Isle of Wight]]. The Chalk, which once extended across the [[English Channel]], gives rise to similar cliff features on the French coast.

==Offshore and elsewhere==

===Northern Ireland===
In the 'Ulster Cretaceous Province' of [[Northern Ireland]] the [[Clastic rock|clastic]]-dominated [[Hibernian Greensands Group]] and the overlying [[Ulster White Limestone Group]] are the stratigraphical equivalents of the Chalk Group of England. They are best exposed near the [[County Antrim|Antrim]] coast.

===Scotland===
In the '[[Scotland|Scottish]] Chalk Province' (extending from [[Isle of Mull|Mull]] to [[Skye]]) the [[Inner Hebrides Group]] is the stratigraphical equivalent of England's Chalk Group. It comprises largely [[sandstone]]s and [[mudstone]]s though the [[Santonian]] age Gribun Chalk Formation of Mull and nearby [[Morvern]] is recognised.

===The Low Countries===
The Dutch ({{lang-nl|Krijtkalk-Groep}}) and [[Belgium|Belgian]] ({{lang-nl|Krijt-Groep}}) equivalents of the Chalk Group are basically continuous and crop out as a slightly northwest dipping [[monocline]] in a belt from the [[Germany|German]] city of [[Aachen]] to the city of [[Mons]], where they join Cretaceous deposits of the [[Paris Basin]]. North of [[Namur]] the Cretaceous is overlain by younger [[Paleocene]] and [[Eocene]] deposits of the [[Landen Group]].

In the [[Low Countries]], the Chalk Group succession is divided into five formations, from top to base:&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Hack, Robert; Azzam, Rafig; Charlier, Robert}}; '''2004''': ''Engineering Geology for Infrastructure Planning in Europe'', Lecture Notes in Earth Sciences '''104''', Springer, {{ISBN|978-3-540-21075-7}}, p. 491&lt;/ref&gt;
*the [[Houthem Formation]], consisting of Paleocene calcareous arenites;
*the [[Maastricht Formation]], consisting of [[Maastrichtian]] chalk and calcareous [[arenite]]s;
*the Gulpen Formation, consisting of [[Campanian]] to Maastrichtian chalk;
*the Vaals Formation, consisting of alternating Campanian clays, glauconiferous sands and silts;
*the [[Aachen Formation]], consisting of [[Santonian]] glauconiferous sands and silts.
In Belgium, the Houthem Formation is sometimes not included in the Chalk Group because it is not a Cretaceous formation. Some stratigraphers therefore prefer to put it in the lower [[Paleogene]] [[Hesbaye Group]].

===The English Channel===
The [[Channel Tunnel]] linking [[England]] and [[France]] was constructed by tunnelling through the West Melbury Marly Chalk (formerly the 'Chalk Marl' - a prominent sub-unit of the Grey Chalk Subgroup).

===The North Sea===
{{see also|Geology of the North Sea}}
The chalk is also an important [[petroleum reservoir]] in the North Sea Central [[Graben]], mainly in [[Norway|Norwegian]] and [[Denmark|Danish]] sectors and to a lesser extent in the [[United Kingdom Continental Shelf]] sector (UKCS).&lt;ref name="DECC"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.og.decc.gov.uk/UKpromote/posters/The_Chalk_play_of_the_UK_Central_Graben.pdf | title=The Chalk play of the UK Central Graben | publisher=[[Department of Energy and Climate Change]] | date=2006 | accessdate=18 April 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418152855/https://www.og.decc.gov.uk/UKpromote/posters/The_Chalk_play_of_the_UK_Central_Graben.pdf | archivedate=18 April 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Across the north central and northern North Sea, the Chalk Group is a major seal unit, overlying a number of blocks of reservoir rocks and preventing their fluid contents from migrating upwards. North of the line of the Mid-North Sea - Ringkobing - Fyn structural high, the Chalk Group is still recognisable in drilled samples, but becomes increasingly muddy northwards. North of the Beryl Embayment (59°30' N 01°30'E), the Chalk Group is a series of slightly to moderately calcareous mudstones grouped under the name of the [[Shetland]] Group. With the exception of some thin sandy units in the inner [[Moray Firth]], this sequence has neither source potential nor reservoir capacity and is not generally considered a drilling target. Its thickness and homogeneity does make it a common target for carrying out [[directional drilling]] manoeuvers.

In the Shearwater and [[Eastern Trough Area Project]] areas (around 56°30' N 02°30'E, UKCS quadrants 22,23,29 and 30), the Chalk Group can be significantly overpressured. Further south in UKCS quadrant 30 and Norwegian quadrants 1 and 2, this overpressure helps preserve porosity and enables the Chalk to be an effective reservoir.

===Reservoir geology===
The majority of Chalk [[Petroleum reservoir|reservoirs]] are redeposited [[allochthon]]ous beds. These include debris flows and [[turbidite]] flows. [[Porosity|Porosities]] can be very high when preserved from [[diagenesis]] by early [[hydrocarbon]] charge. However, when these hydrocarbons are produced, diagenesis and compaction can restart which has led to several metres of subsidence at seabed, the collapse of a number of wells, and some ''extremely'' expensive remedial work to lift the platforms and re-position them.&lt;ref name="DECC"/&gt;

[[Image:Diamond Core.jpeg|thumb|right|300px|Rock core samples, the product of a [[Drilling rig#Diamond core drilling|diamond rig]]. A [[pied butcherbird]] perches nearby.]]
A '''core sample''' is a cylindrical section of (usually) a naturally occurring substance. Most core samples are obtained by drilling with special drills into the substance, for example sediment or rock, with a hollow [[steel]] tube called a [[core drill]]. The hole made for the core sample is called the "core bowling". A variety of core samplers exist to sample different media under different conditions. More continue to be invented on a regular basis. In the coring process, the sample is pushed more or less intact into the tube. Removed from the tube in the laboratory, it is inspected and analyzed by different techniques and equipment depending on the type of data desired.

Core samples can be taken to test the properties of [[manmade]] materials, such as [[concrete]], [[ceramic]]s, some [[metal]]s and alloys, especially the softer ones. Core samples can also be taken of living things, including human beings, especially of a person's bones for microscopic examination to help diagnose diseases.

== Methods ==
[[Image:Granitic_core_Stillwater.jpg|thumb|60px|Granitic rock core from [[Stillwater igneous complex]], Montana (from a spoil pile).]]
The composition of the subject materials can vary from almost liquid to the strongest materials found in nature or technology, and the location of the subject materials can vary from on the laboratory bench to over 10&amp;nbsp;km from the surface of the Earth in a borehole. The range of equipment and techniques applied to the task is correspondingly great. Core samples are most often taken with their long axis oriented roughly parallel to the axis of a borehole, or parallel to the gravity field for the gravity-driven tools. However it is also possible to take core samples from the wall of an existing borehole. Taking samples from an exposure, albeit an overhanging rock face or on a different planet, is almost trivial. (The Mars Exploration Rovers carry a [[Rock Abrasion Tool]], which is logically equivalent to the "rotary sidewall core" tool described below.)

Some common techniques include:
* ''gravity coring'', in which the core sampler is dropped into the sample, usually the bed of a water body, but essentially the same technique can also be done on soft materials on land. The penetration forces, if recorded, give information about the strength of different depths in the material, which may be the only information required, with samples as an incidental benefit. This technique is common in both civil engineering site investigations (where the techniques tend towards into [[pile driving]]) and geological studies of recent aquatic deposits. The low strength of the materials penetrated means that cores have to be relatively small.
* ''vibracoring'', in which the sampler is vibrated to allow penetration into [[thixotropic]] media. Again, the physical strength of the subject material limits the size of core that can be retrieved.
* ''drilling'' [[exploration diamond drilling]] where a rotating annular tool backed up by a cylindrical core sample storage device is pressed against the subject materials to cut out a cylinder of the subject material. A mechanism is normally needed to retain the cylindrical sample in the coring tool. Depending on circumstances, particularly the consistency and composition of the subject materials, different arrangements may be needed within the core tools to support and protect the sample on its way to surface; it is often also necessary to control or reduce the contact between the [[drilling fluid]] and the core sample, to reduce changes from the coring process. The mechanical forces imposed on the core sample by the tool frequently lead to fracture of the core and loss of less-competent intervals, which can greatly complicate interpretation of the core. Cores can routinely be cut as small as a few [[millimeter]]s in diameter (in wood, for [[dendrochronology]]) up to over 150 millimeters in diameter (routine in [[oil exploration]]). The lengths of samples can range from less than a meter (again, in wood, for [[dendrochronology]]) up to around 200 metres in one run, though 27m to 54m is more usual (in [[oil exploration]]), and many runs can be made in succession if "quick look" analysis in the field suggests that the zone of interest is continuing.
* ''percussion sidewall coring'' uses robust cylindrical "bullets" explosively propelled into the wall of a borehole to retrieve a (relatively) small, short core sample. These tend to be heavily shattered, rendering [[porosity]]/ [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] measurements dubious, but are often sufficient for [[petrography|lithological]] and [[micropaleontology|micropalaeontological]] study. Many samples can be attempted in a single run of the tools, which are typically configured with 20 to 30 "bullets" and propulsive charges along the length of a tool. Several tools can often be ganged together for a single run. The success rates for firing a particular bullet, it penetrating the borehole wall, the retention system recovering the bullet from the borehole wall, and the sample being retained in the bullet are all relatively low, so it is not uncommon for only half the samples attempted to be successful. This is an important consideration in planning sample programmes.
* ''rotary sidewall coring'' where a miniaturised automated rotary drilling tool is applied to the side of the borehole to cut a sample similar in size to a percussion sidewall core (described above). These tend to suffer less deformation than percussion cores. However the core-cutting process takes longer and jams are common in the ancillary equipment which retrieves the sample from the drill bit and stores it within the tool body. This complicates the planning of a coring programme.

==Management of cores and data==
Although often neglected, core samples always degrade to some degree in the process of cutting the core, handling it, and studying it. Non-destructive techniques are increasingly common (e.g. the use of [[MRI]] scanning to characterize grains, pore fluids, pore spaces ([[porosity]]) and their interactions (constituting part of [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]]) but such expensive subtlety is likely wasted on a core that has been shaken on an unsprung lorry for 300&amp;nbsp;km of dirt road.  What happens to cores between the retrieval equipment and the final laboratory (or archive) is an often neglected part of record keeping and core management.

[[File:Cut Bakken Core samples.jpg|thumb|Cut [[Bakken formation|Bakken]] Core samples]]Coring has come to be recognized as an important source of data, and more attention and care is being put on preventing damage to the core during various stages of it transportation and analysis. The usual way to do this is to freeze the core completely using liquid nitrogen, which is cheaply sourced. In some cases, special polymers are also used to preserve and seat/cushion the core from damage.

Equally, a core sample which cannot be related to its context (where it was before it became a core sample) has lost much of its benefit. The identification of the borehole, and the position and orientation ("way up") of the core in the borehole is critical, even if the borehole is in a tree trunk – [[dendrochronology|dendrochronologists]] always try to include a bark surface in their samples so that the date of most-recent growth of the tree can be unambiguously determined.

If these data become separated from core samples, it is generally impossible to regain that data. The cost of a coring operation can vary from a few currency units (for a hand-caught core from a soft soil section) to tens of millions of currency units (for sidewall cores from a remote-area offshore borehole many kilometres deep). Inadequate recording of such basic data has ruined the utility of both types of core.

Different disciplines have different local conventions of recording these data, and the user should familiarize themselves with their area's conventions. For example, in the oil industry, orientation of the core is typically recorded by marking the core with two longitudinal colour streaks, with the red one on the right when the core is being retrieved and marked at surface. Cores cut for mineral mining may have their own, different, conventions. Civil engineering or soil studies may have their own, different, conventions as their materials are often not competent enough to make permanent marks on.

[[File:Bakken Core samples under a black light.jpg|thumb|Bakken Core samples under a black light]]It is becoming increasingly common to retain core samples in cylindrical packaging which forms part of the core-cutting equipment, and to make the marks of record on these "inner barrels" in the field prior to further processing and analysis in the laboratory.  Sometimes core is shipped from the field to the laboratory in as long a length as it comes out of the ground; other times it is cut into standard lengths (5m or 1m or 3&amp;nbsp;ft) for shipping, then reassembled in the laboratory. Some of the "inner barrel" systems are capable of being reversed on the core sample, so that in the laboratory the sample goes "wrong way up" when the core is reassembled. This can complicate interpretation. [[File:Oriented Core Goniometer commonly used when logging core.JPG|thumb|Goniometers are used to measure angles of fractures and other features in a core sample relative to its standard orientation.]]

If the borehole has [[petrophysics|petrophysical]] measurements made of the wall rocks, and these measurements are repeated along the length of the core then the two data sets correlated, one will almost universally find that the depth "of record" for a particular piece of core differs between the two methods of measurement. Which set of measurements to believe then becomes a matter of policy for the client (in an industrial setting) or of great controversy (in a context without an overriding authority. Recording that there are discrepancies, for whatever reason, retains the possibility of correcting an incorrect decision at a later date ; destroying the "incorrect" depth data makes it impossible to correct a mistake later. Any system for retaining and archiving data and core samples needs to be designed so that dissenting opinion like this can be retained.

If core samples from a campaign are competent, it is common practice to "slab" them – cut the sample into two or more samples longitudinally – quite early in laboratory processing so that one set of samples can be archived early in the analysis sequence as a protection against errors in processing. "Slabbing" the core into a 2/3 and a 1/3 set is common. It is also common for one set to be retained by the main customer while the second set goes to the government (who often impose a condition for such donation as a condition of exploration/ exploitation licensing). "Slabbing" also has the benefit of preparing a flat, smooth surface for examination and testing of profile permeability, which is very much easier to work with than the typically rough, curved surface of core samples when they're fresh from the coring equipment. Photography of raw and "slabbed" core surfaces is routine, often under both natural and ultra-violet light.
[[File:Pulling the Bakken Core out of the core barrell.JPG|thumb|Pulling the Bakken Core out of the core barrell]]

A unit of length occasionally used in the literature on seabed cores is ''cmbsf'', an abbreviation for centimeters below sea floor.

==History of coring==
The technique of coring long predates attempts to drill into the [[Earth]]’s [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] by the [[Deep Sea Drilling Program]]. The value to oceanic and other [[geologic history]] of obtaining cores over a wide area of [[sea floor]]s soon became apparent. Core sampling by many scientific and exploratory organizations expanded rapidly. To date hundreds of thousands of core samples have been collected from floors of all the planet's [[ocean]]s and many of its [[inland waters]]. 
Access to many of these samples is facilitated by the [[Index to Marine &amp; Lacustrine Geological Samples]],
:"A collaboration between twenty institutions and agencies that operate geological repositories."
The above agency keeps a record of the samples held in the repositories of its member organizations. Data includes

[[File:Lower Bakken-3 Forks Transition.JPG|thumb|Lower Bakken-3 Forks Transition]]

==Informational value of core samples==

Coring began as a method of sampling surroundings of ore deposits and oil exploration. It soon expanded to [[ocean]]s, [[lake]]s, [[Ice core|ice]], [[mud]], [[soil]] and [[Dendrochronology|wood]]. Cores on very old [[tree]]s give information about their growth rings without destroying the tree.

Cores indicate variations of [[climate]], [[species]] and [[sediment]]ary composition during geologic history. The dynamic phenomena of the Earth's surface are for the most part cyclical in a number of ways, especially [[temperature]] and [[rainfall]].

There are many ways to date a core. Once dated, it gives valuable information about changes of climate and [[terrain]]. For example, cores in the ocean floor, soil and ice have altered the view of the geologic history of the [[Pleistocene]] entirely.

'''Decline curve analysis''' is a means of predicting future [[oil well]] or gas well production based on past production history. Production decline curve analysis is a traditional means of identifying well production problems and predicting well performance and life based on measured oil well production.&lt;ref&gt;http://infohost.nmt.edu/~petro/faculty/Kelly/Deline.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  
Before the availability of computers, decline curve analysis was performed by hand on [[semi-log plot]] paper. Currently, decline curve analysis software on PC computers is used to plot production decline curves for petroleum economics analysis.

==Background==
Oil and gas wells usually reach their maximum output shortly after [[completion (oil and gas wells)|completion]]. From that time, other than wells completed in water-drive reservoirs, they decline in production, the rapidity of decline depending on the output of the wells and on other factors governing their productivity. The production decline curve shows the amount of oil and gas produced per unit of time for several consecutive periods; if the conditions affecting the rate of production are not changed, the curve may be fairly regular, and, if projected, will furnish useful knowledge as to the future production of the well. By the aid of this knowledge the value of a property may be judged, and proper depletion and depreciation charges may be made on the books of the operating company.({{Harvnb|Lewis|1918}})&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/transactionsmining59amer/transactionsmining59amer_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

Production decline curve analysis is important in determining the value in oil and gas wells in oil and gas economics.  Decline curves are the most common means of forecasting oil and gas production.  Decline curves have many advantages: they use data which is easy to obtain, they are easy to plot, they yield results on a time basis, and they are easy to analyze.  Decline curves are also one of the oldest methods of predicting oil reserves.({{Harvnb|Thompson|1985}})

'''Density logging''' is a [[well logging]] tool that can provide a continuous record of a [[Formation (geology)|formation's]] [[bulk density]] along the length of a [[borehole]].  In geology, bulk density is a function of the density of the minerals forming a rock (i.e. [[rock matrix|matrix]]) and the fluid enclosed in the pore spaces.  This is one of three well logging tools that are commonly used to calculate porosity, the other two being [[sonic logging]] and [[Formation evaluation neutron porosity|neutron porosity logging]]

==History &amp; Principle==
The tool was initially developed in the 1950s and was in use throughout the hydrocarbon industry by the 1960s.  A type of active nuclear tool, a [[radioactive source]] and detector are lowered down the borehole and the source emits medium-energy [[gamma ray]]s into the formation.  Radioactive sources are typically a directional Cs-137 source.  These gamma rays interact with electrons in the formation and are scattered in an interaction known as [[Compton scattering]].  The number of scattered gamma rays that reach the detector, placed at a set distance from the emitter, is related to the formation's electron density,&lt;ref name="Gluyas"&gt;Gluyas, J. &amp; Swarbrick, R. (2004) Petroleum Geoscience. Publ. Blackwell Publishing. p32&lt;/ref&gt; which itself is related to the formation's bulk density (&lt;math&gt;\rho_\text{bulk}&lt;/math&gt;) via
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_\text{e} = 2\rho_\text{bulk} \ \frac{ Z}{A}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;  is the atomic number, and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the molecular weight of the compound. For most elements &lt;math&gt;Z/A&lt;/math&gt; is about 1/2 (except for hydrogen where this ratio is 1). The electron density (&lt;math&gt;\rho_\text{e}&lt;/math&gt;) in g/cm³ determines the response of the density tool.

==General tool design==

The tool itself initially consisted of a radioactive source and a single detector, but this configuration is susceptible to the effects of the [[drilling fluid]].  In a similar way to how the [[sonic logging]] tool was improved to compensate for borehole effects, density logging now conventionally uses 2 or more detectors.  In a 2 detector configuration, the short-spaced detector has a much shallower depth of investigation than the long-spaced detector so it is used to measure the effect that the drilling fluid has on the gamma ray detection.  This result is then used to correct the long-spaced detector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=compensated-density%20log Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary. Compensated-density Log.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inferring porosity from bulk density==

Assuming that the measured bulk density (&lt;math&gt;\rho_\text{bulk}&lt;/math&gt;) only depends on [[rock matrix|matrix]] density (&lt;math&gt;\rho_\text{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;) and fluid density (&lt;math&gt;\rho_\text{fluid}&lt;/math&gt;), and that these values are known along the wellbore, [[porosity]] (&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;) can be inferred by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \frac{\rho_\text{matrix} - \rho_\text{bulk}}{\rho_\text{matrix}-\rho_\text{fluid}}&lt;/math&gt;

Common values of matrix density &lt;math&gt;\rho_\text{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; (in [[gram|g]]/cm³) are:

* [[Quartz]] sand - 2.65
* [[Limestone]] - 2.71
* [[Dolomite (rock)|Dolomite]] - 2.87

This method is the most reliable porosity indicator for sandstones and limestones because their density is well known.&lt;ref name=Gluyas /&gt;  On the other hand, the density of [[clay mineral]]s such as [[mudstone]] is highly variable, depending on [[depositional environment]], [[overburden]] pressure, type of clay mineral and many other factors. It can vary from 2.1 (montmorillonite) to 2.76 (chlorite) so this tool is not as useful for determining their porosity.  A fluid bulk density &lt;math&gt;\rho_\text{fluid}&lt;/math&gt; of 1 [[gram|g]]/cm³ is appropriate where the water is fresh but highly [[saline water]] has a slightly higher density and lower values should be used for [[hydrocarbon reservoir]]s, depending on the hydrocarbon density and residual saturation.

In some applications hydrocarbons are indicated by the presence of abnormally high log porosities.

[[Image:Drill cuttings - Annotated - 2004.jpg|right|400 px]]

'''Drill cuttings'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=cuttings Schlumberger: Oilfield Glossary&lt;/ref&gt; are the broken bits of solid material removed from a [[borehole]] drilled by [[rotary drilling|rotary]], [[percussion drill|percussion]], or [[Auger_(drill)|auger]] methods and brought to the surface in the [[drilling mud]]. Boreholes drilled in this way include [[Oil well|oil or gas wells]], [[Water well|water wells]], and holes drilled for geotechnical investigations or mineral exploration.

The drill cuttings are commonly examined to make a record (a [[well log]]) of the subsurface materials penetrated at various depths. In the oil industry, this is often called a [[mud log]].

Drill cuttings are produced as the rock is broken by the drill bit advancing through the rock or soil; the cuttings are usually carried to the surface by [[drilling fluid]] circulating up from the drill bit. Drill cuttings can be separated from liquid drilling fluid by [[shale shakers]], by centrifuges, or by [[Cyclonic separation|cyclone separators]], the latter also being effective for air drilling. In cable-tool drilling, the drill cuttings are periodically bailed out of the bottom of the hole. In [[auger drilling]], cuttings are carried to the surface on the auger flights.

One drilling method that does not produce drill cuttings is [[core drill]]ing, which instead produces solid cylinders of rock or soil.

==Management of drill cuttings==

Drill cuttings carried by mud (drilling fluid) are usually retrieved at the surface of the platform where they go through shakers or vibrating machines to separate the cuttings from the drilling fluid, this process allows the circulating fluid to renter the drilling process. 

Samples from the cuttings are then studied by [[Mud logging|mud loggers]] and [[Geologist|wellsite geologist]]. In the [[Oil and gas industry in the United Kingdom|Oil and Gas]] industry the operator will likely require a set of samples for further analysis in their labs. Many national regulations stipulate that for any well drilled a set of samples must be archived with a national body. For example in the case of the UK with the British Geological Survey ([[British Geological Survey|BGS]]).

The bulk of the cuttings require disposal. The methodology is dependent on the type of drilling fluid use. For water based drilling fluid (WBM) with no particular dangerous additives, the cuttings can be dumped overboard (in offshore senario). If however an oil based drilling fluid ([[Oil-based mud|OBM]]) is used then the cuttings must be processed before disposal. Either in skips and transported to a dedicated facility (aka skip and ship), or now there are mobile plants that can process them at the rigsite effectively burning off the drilling fluid contamination. This saves the [[logistics]] and cost of transporting such quantities of cuttings. Although possibly thought of as a uninteresting topic, if in a skip and ship scenario, the dependency on crane operations to move skips can lead to situations whereby bad weather halts drilling as the cuttings handling cannot continue.

==Disposal as waste==
===Burial===
Burial is the placement of waste in man-made or natural excavations, such as pits or [[landfills]]. Burial is the most common onshore disposal technique used for disposing of drilling wastes (mud and cuttings). Generally, the solids are buried in the same pit (the reserve pit) used for collection and temporary storage of the waste mud and cuttings after the liquid is allowed to evaporate. Pit burial is a low-cost, low-tech method that does not require wastes to be transported away from the well site, and, therefore, is very attractive to many operators.

Burial may be the most misunderstood or misapplied disposal technique. Simply pushing the walls of the reserve pit over the drilled cuttings is generally not acceptable. The depth or placement of the burial cell is important. A moisture content limit should be established on the buried cuttings, and the chemical composition should be determined. Onsite pit burial may not be a good choice for wastes that contain high concentrations of oil, salt, biologically available metals, industrial chemicals, and other materials with harmful components that could migrate from the pit and contaminate usable water resources.

In some [[oil field]] areas, large landfills are operated to dispose of oil field wastes from multiple wells. Burial usually results in anaerobic conditions, which limits any further degradation when compared with wastes that are land-farmed or land-spread, where aerobic conditions predominate.&lt;ref name=anl&gt;http://web.ead.anl.gov/dwm/techdesc/burial/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application to land surfaces==

The objective of applying drilling wastes to the land is to allow the soil's naturally occurring microbial population to metabolize, transform, and assimilate waste constituents in place. Land application is a form of [[bioremediation]] are described in a separate fact sheet.

Several terms are used to describe this [[waste management]] approach, which can be considered both treatment and disposal. In general, ''land farming'' refers to the repeated application of wastes to the soil surface, whereas ''land spreading'' and ''land treatment'' are often used interchangeably to describe the one-time application of wastes to the soil surface. Some practitioners do not follow the same terminology convention, and may interchange all three terms. Readers should focus on the technologies rather than on the specific names given to each process.

Optimal land application techniques balance the additions of waste against a soil's capacity to assimilate the waste constituents without destroying soil integrity, creating subsurface [[soil contamination]] problems, or causing other adverse environmental impacts.

==Land farming==
{{Main|Landfarming}}
The exploration and production industry has used land farming to treat oily petroleum industry wastes for years. Land farming is the controlled and repeated application of wastes to the soil surface, using microorganisms in the soil to naturally biodegrade hydrocarbon constituents, dilute and attenuate metals, and transform and assimilate waste constituents.

Land farming can be a relatively low-cost drilling waste management approach. Some studies indicate that land farming does not adversely affect soils and may even benefit certain sandy soils by increasing their water-retaining capacity and reducing fertilizer losses. Inorganic compounds and metals are diluted in the soil, and may also be incorporated into the matrix (through chelation, exchange reactions, covalent bonding, or other processes) or may become less soluble through oxidation, precipitation, and pH effects. The attenuation of heavy metals (or the taking up of metals by plants) can depend on clay content and cation-exchange capacity.

Optimizing Land Farm Operations: The addition of water, nutrients, and other amendments (e.g., manure, straw) can increase the biological activity and aeration of the soil, thereby preventing the development of conditions that might promote leaching and mobilization of inorganic contaminants. During periods of extended dry conditions, moisture control may also be needed to minimize dust.

Periodic tillage of the mixture (to increase aeration) and nutrient additions to the waste-soil mixture can enhance aerobic biodegradation of hydrocarbons. After applying the wastes, hydrocarbon concentrations are monitored to measure progress and determine the need for enhancing the biodegradation processes. Application rates should be controlled to minimize the potential for runoff.

Pretreating the wastes by composting and activating aerobic biodegradation by regular turning (windrows) or by forced ventilation (biopiles) can reduce the amount of acreage required for land farming (Morillon et al. 2002).

Drilling Waste Land Farm Example: In 1995, HS Resources, an oil and gas company operating in Colorado, obtained a permit for a noncommercial land farm to treat and recycle the company's nonhazardous oil field wastes, including drilling muds. At the land farm, wastes mixed with soil contaminated with hydrocarbons from other facilities are spread in a layer one foot thick or less. Natural bacterial action is enhanced through occasional addition of commercial fertilizers, monthly tilling (to add oxygen), and watering (to maintain 10–15% moisture content). Treatment is considered complete when hydrocarbon levels reach concentrations specified by regulatory agencies; not all agencies employ the same acceptability standards. Water and soil are monitored periodically to confirm that no adverse soil or groundwater impacts have occurred, and records of the source and disposition of the remediated soil are maintained. Estimated treatment costs, which include transportation, spreading, amendments, and monitoring, are about $4–5 per cubic yard. When the treated material is recycled as backfill, net costs are about $1 per cubic yard. Capital costs (not included in the treatment cost estimates) were recovered within the first eight months of operation (Cole and Mark 2000).

Implementation Considerations: Advantages of land farming include its simplicity and low capital cost, the ability to apply multiple waste loadings to the same parcel of land, and the potential to improve soil conditions. Concerns associated with land farming are its high maintenance costs (e.g., for periodic land tilling, fertilizer); potentially large land requirements; and required analysis, testing, demonstration, and monitoring. Elevated concentrations of hydrocarbons in drilling wastes can limit the application rate of a waste on a site.

Wastes containing salt must also be applied to soil only with care. Salt, unlike hydrocarbons, cannot biodegrade but may accumulate in soils, which have a limited capacity to accept salts. If salt levels become too high, the soils may be damaged and treatment of hydrocarbons can be inhibited. Salts are soluble in water and can be managed. Salt management is part of prudent operation of a land farm.

Another concern with land farming is that while lower molecularweight petroleum compounds biodegrade efficiently, higher molecular weight compounds biodegrade more slowly. This means that repeated applications can lead to accumulation of high molecular weight compounds. At high concentrations, these recalcitrant constituents can increase soil-water repellency, affect plant growth, reduce the ability of the soil to support a diverse community of organisms, and render the land farm no longer usable without treatment or amendment.&lt;ref&gt;Callahan et al. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have supported the idea that field-scale additions of earthworms with selected organic amendments may hasten the long-term recovery of conventionally treated petroleum contaminated soil. The burrowing and feeding activities of earthworms create space and allow food resources to become available to other soil organisms that would be unable to survive otherwise. The use of earthworms in Europe has improved the biological quality of soils of some large-scale land-reclamation projects.

When considering land farming as a waste management option, several items should be considered. These include site topography, site hydrology, neighboring land use, and the physical (texture and bulk density) and chemical composition of the waste and the resulting waste-soil mixture. Wastes that contain large amounts of oil and various additives may have diverse effects on parts of the food chain. Constituents of particular concern include pH, nitrogen (total mass), major soluble ions (Ca, Mg, Na, Cl), electrical conductivity, total metals, extractable organic halogens, oil content, and hydrocarbons. Oil-based muds typically utilize an emulsified phase of 20 to 35 percent by weight CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; brine. This salt can be a problem in some areas, such as some parts of Canada, the mid-continent, and the Rocky Mountains. For this reason, alternative mud systems have emerged that use an environmentally preferred beneficial salt, such as [[calcium nitrate]] or [[potassium sulfate]], as the emulsified internal water phase.

Wastes that contain significant levels of biologically available heavy metals and persistent toxic compounds are not good candidates for land farming, as these substances can accumulate in the soil to a level that renders the land unfit for further use (E&amp;P Forum 1993). (Site monitoring can help ensure such accumulation does not occur.) Land farms may require permits or other approvals from regulatory agencies, and, depending on soil conditions, some land farms may require liners and/or groundwater monitoring wells.

==Land treatment==

In land treatment (also known as land spreading), the processes are similar to those in land farming, where natural soil processes are used to biodegrade the organic constituents in the waste. However, in land treatment, a one-time application of the waste is made to a parcel of land. The objective is to dispose of the waste in a manner that preserves the subsoil's chemical, biological, and physical properties by limiting the accumulation of contaminants and protecting the quality of surface and groundwater. The land spreading area is determined on the basis of a calculated loading rate that considers the absolute salt concentration, hydrocarbon concentration, metals concentration, and pH level after mixing with the soil. The drilling waste is spread on the land and incorporated into the upper soil zone (typically upper 6–8&amp;nbsp;inches of soil) to enhance hydrocarbon volatization and biodegradation. The land is managed so that the soil system can degrade, transport, and assimilate the waste constituents. Each land treatment site is generally used only once.

Optimizing Land Treatment Operations: Addition of water, nutrients, and other amendments (e.g., manure, straw) can increase the biological activity and aeration of the soil and prevent the development of conditions that might promote leaching and mobilization of inorganic contaminants. During periods of extended dry conditions, moisture control may also be needed to minimize dust. Periodic tillage of the mixture (to increase aeration) and nutrient additions to the waste soil mixture can enhance aerobic biodegradation of hydrocarbons, although in practice not all land treatment projects include repeated tilling. After applying the wastes, hydrocarbon concentrations may be monitored to measure progress and determine the need for enhancing the biodegradation processes.

Implementation Considerations: Because land spreading sites receive only a single application of waste, the potential for accumulation of waste components in the soil is reduced (as compared with land farming, where waste is applied repeatedly). Although liners and monitoring of leachate are typically not required at land treatment sites, site topography, hydrology, and the physical and chemical composition of the waste and resultant waste-soil mixture should be assessed, with waste application rates controlled to minimize the possibility of runoff.

Experiments conducted in France showed that after spreading oil-based mud cuttings on farmland, followed by plowing, tilling, and fertilizing, approximately 10% of the initial quantity of the oil remained in the soil. Phytotoxic effects on seed germination and sprouting were not observed, but corn and wheat crop yields decreased by 10%.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith et al. 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Yields of other crops were not affected. The percentage of hydrocarbon reduction and crop yield performance will vary from site to site depending on many factors (e.g., length of time after application, type of hydrocarbon, soil chemistry, temperature).

Land spreading costs are typically $2.50 to $3.00 per barrel of water-based drilling fluids not contaminated with oil, and they could be higher for oily wastes containing salts (Bansal and Sugiarto 1999). Costs also depend on sampling and analytical requirements.

Advantages of land spreading are the low treatment cost and the possibility that the approach could improve soil characteristics. Land spreading is most effectively used for drilling wastes that have low levels of hydrocarbons and salts. Potential concerns include the need for large land areas; the relatively slow degradation process (the rate of biodegradation is controlled by the inherent biodegradation properties of the waste constituents, soil temperature, soil-water content, and contact between the microorganisms and the wastes); and the need for analyses, tests, and demonstrations. Also, high concentrations of soluble salts or metals can limit the use of land spreading.

When evaluating land spreading as a drilling waste management option, several items should be considered. These include area-wide topographical and geological features; current and likely future activities around the disposal site; hydrogeologic data (location, size, and direction of flow for existing surface water bodies and fresh or usable aquifers); natural or existing drainage patterns; nearby environmentally sensitive features such as wetlands, urban areas, historical or archeological sites, and protected habitats; the presence of endangered species; and potential air quality impacts. In addition, historical rainfall distribution data should be reviewed to establish moisture requirements for land spreading and predict net evaporation rates. Devices needed to control water flow into, onto, or from facility systems should be identified. Wastes should be characterized during the evaluation; drilling wastes with high levels of hydrocarbons and salts may not be appropriate for land spreading.

==Recycling==

Some cuttings are being beneficially reused. Before the cuttings can be reused or recycled, it may be necessary to follow steps to ensure the hydrocarbon and chloride content is lowered within the governing bodies standards for reuse.

Reuse of cuttings through road spreading is permitted in some areas. However it depends on permission from not only the governing agency, but also the land owner.

Drill cutting can also be recycled for use as a bulk particulate solid construction materials such as road base for site roads and pads. The cuttings must first be screened and dried, before being processes in a pugmill or similar type mixing method.&lt;ref name=anl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roughneckcity.com/uploads/Drilling_Waste_Management_Technology_1_.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511073339/http://www.roughneckcity.com/uploads/Drilling_Waste_Management_Technology_1_.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drilling wastes can also be recycled for use as a major constituent of mixes for making substantially monolithic specialized civil engineering concrete structures of large size, such as roads and drilling pads.

A '''drill string''' on a [[drilling rig]] is a column, or string, of [[drill pipe]] that transmits [[drilling fluid]] (via the [[mud pump]]s) and torque (via the [[kelly drive]] or [[top drive]]) to the [[Well_drilling#Drill_bits_in_mechanical_drilling|drill bit]]. The term is loosely applied to the assembled collection of the drill pipe, [[drill collar]]s, tools and drill bit. The drill string is hollow so that [[drilling fluid]] can be pumped down through it and circulated back up the [[Annulus (oil well)|annulus]] (the void between the drill string and the casing/open hole).

== Drill string components ==
The drill string is typically made up of three sections:
* Bottom hole assembly (BHA)
* Transition pipe, which is often heavyweight drill pipe (HWDP)
* Drill pipe

=== Bottom hole assembly (BHA) ===
The Bottom Hole Assembly (BHA) is made up of: a [[drill bit#Well drilling bits|drill bit]], which is used to break up the rock [[Geologic formation|formation]]s; [[drill collar]]s, which are heavy, thick-walled tubes used to apply weight to the drill bit; and [[drilling stabilizer]]s, which keep the assembly centered in the hole. The BHA may also contain other components such as a [[downhole motor]] and [[rotary steerable system]](RSS), [[Measurement While Drilling|measurement while drilling]] (MWD), and [[Logging While Drilling|logging while drilling]] (LWD) tools.  The components are joined together using rugged threaded connections. Short "subs" are used to connect items with dissimilar threads.

=== Transition pipe ===
Heavyweight drill pipe (HWDP) may be used to make the transition between the drill collars and drill pipe. The function of the HWDP is to provide a flexible transition between the drill collars and the drill pipe. This helps to reduce the number of fatigue failures seen directly above the BHA. A secondary use of HWDP is to add additional weight to the drill bit. HWDP is most often used as weight on bit in deviated wells. The HWDP may be directly above the collars in the angled section of the well, or the HWDP may be found before the kick off point in a shallower section of the well.

=== Drill pipe ===
Drill pipe makes up the majority of the drill string back up to the surface.  Each drill pipe comprises a long tubular section with a specified outside diameter (e.g. 3 1/2 inch, 4 inch, 5 inch, 5 1/2 inch, 5 7/8 inch, 6 5/8 inch). At each end of the drill pipe tubular, larger-diameter portions called the tool joints are located. One end of the drill pipe has a male ("pin") connection whilst the other has a female ("box") connection. The tool joint connections are threaded which allows for the mating of each drill pipe segment to the next segment.

== Running a drill string ==
Most components in a drill string are manufactured in 31 foot lengths (range 2) although they can also be manufactured in 46 foot lengths (range 3). Each 31 foot component is referred to as a joint. Typically 2, 3 or 4 joints are joined together to make a stand. Modern onshore rigs are capable of handling ~90&amp;nbsp;ft stands (often referred to as a triple).

Pulling the drill string out of or running the drill string into the hole is referred to as '''tripping'''. Drill pipe, HWDP and collars are typically racked  back in stands in to the monkeyboard which is a component of the derrick if they are to be run back into the hole again after, say, changing the bit.  The disconnect point ("break") is varied each subsequent round trip so that after three trips every connection has been broken apart and later made up again with fresh pipe dope applied.

== Stuck drill string ==
A stuck drill string can be caused by many situations.

*Packing-off due to cuttings settling back into the wellbore when circulation is stopped.
*Differentially when there is a large difference between formation pressure and wellbore pressure. The drill string is pushed against one side of the well bore. The force required to pull the string along the wellbore in this occurrence is a function of the total contact surface area, the pressure difference and the friction factor.
*Keyhole sticking occurs mechanically as a result of pulling up into doglegs when tripping.
*Adhesion due to not moving it for a significant amount of time.

Once the tubular member is stuck, there are many techniques used to extract the pipe. The tools and expertise are normally supplied by an oilfield service company. Two popular tools and techniques are the oilfield jar and the surface [[resonant]] vibrator. Below is a history of these tools along with how they operate.

=== History of Jars ===
[[File:8 inch drilling jar 532.jpg|thumb|8 inch drilling jar (red and white) on casings]]
The mechanical success of [[cable tool drilling]] has greatly depended on a device called jars, invented by a spring pole driller, William Morris, in the salt well days of the 1830s. Little is known about Morris except for his invention and that he listed Kanawha County (now in West Virginia) as his address. Morris received {{cite patent|US|2243}} for this unique tool in 1841 for artesian well drilling.  Later, using jars, the cable tool system was able to efficiently meet the demands of drilling wells for oil.

The jars were improved over time, especially at the hands of the oil drillers, and reached the most useful and workable design by the 1870s, due to another {{cite patent|US|78958}} received in 1868 by Edward Guillod of Titusville, Pennsylvania, which addressed the use of steel on the jars' surfaces that were subject to the greatest wear.  Many years later, in the 1930s, very strong steel alloy jars were made.

A set of jars consisted of two interlocking links which could telescope.  In 1880 they had a play of about 13&amp;nbsp;inches such that the upper link could be lifted 13&amp;nbsp;inches before the lower link was engaged. This engagement occurred when the cross-heads came together.Today, there are two primary types, hydraulic and mechanical jars. While their respective designs are quite different, their operation is similar. Energy is stored in the drillstring and suddenly released by the jar when it fires. Jars can be designed to strike up, down, or both. In the case of jarring up above a stuck bottomhole assembly, the driller slowly pulls up on the drillstring but the BHA does not move. Since the top of the drillstring is moving up, this means that the drillstring itself is stretching and storing energy. When the jars reach their firing point, they suddenly allow one section of the jar to move axially relative to a second, being pulled up rapidly in much the same way that one end of a stretched spring moves when released. After a few inches of movement, this moving section slams into a steel shoulder,
imparting an impact load.

In addition to the mechanical and hydraulic versions, jars are classified as drilling jars or fishing jars. The operation of the two types is similar, and both deliver approximately the same impact blow, but the drilling jar is built such that it can better withstand the rotary and vibrational loading associated with drilling. Jars are designed to be reset by simple string manipulation and are capable of repeated operation or firing before being recovered from the well. Jarring effectiveness is
determined by how rapidly you can impact weight into the jars. When jarring without a compounder or accelerator you rely only on pipe stretch to lift the drill collars upwards after the jar releases to create the upwards impact in the jar. This accelerated upward movement will often be reduced by the friction of the working string along the sides of the well bore, reducing the speed of upwards movement of the drill collars which impact into the jar. At shallow depths jar impact is not achieved because of lack of pipe stretch in the working string.

When pipe stretch alone cannot provide enough energy to free a fish, compounders or accelerators are used. Compounders or accelerators are energized when you over pull on the working string and compress a compressible fluid through a few feet of stroke distance and at the same time activate the fishing jar. When the fishing jar releases the stored energy in the compounder/acclerator lifts the drill collars upwards at a high rate of speed creating a high impact in the jar.

=== System Dynamics of Jars ===

Jars rely on the principle of stretching a pipe to build elastic potential energy such that when the jar trips it relies on the masses of the drill pipe and collars to gain velocity and subsequently strike the anvil section of jar. This impact results in a force, or blow, which is converted into energy.

=== History of Surface Resonant Vibrators ===

[[File:SurfaceResonantVibrator.jpg|thumb|400px|Oilfield Surface Resonant Vibrator]]

The concept of using vibration to free stuck objects from a wellbore originated in the 1940s, and probably stemmed from the 1930s use of vibration to drive piling in the Soviet Union. The early use of vibration for driving and extracting piles was confined to low frequency operation; that is, frequencies less than the fundamental [[resonant frequency]] of the system and consequently, although effective, the process was only an improvement on conventional hammer equipment. Early patents and teaching attempted to explain the process and mechanism involved, but lacked a certain degree of sophistication. In 1961, A. G. Bodine obtained {{cite patent|US|2972380}}&lt;ref&gt;Patent number: 2972380, Filing date: Feb 20, 1956, Issue date: Feb 1961, Inventor: Albert G. Bodine Title: "Acoustic Method and Apparatus For Moving Objects Held Tight Within a Surrounding Medium"&lt;/ref&gt; that was to become the "mother patent" for oil field tubular extraction using sonic techniques. Mr. Bodine introduced the concept of [[Resonance|resonant]] [[vibration]] that effectively eliminated the reactance portion of [[mechanical impedance]], thus leading to the means of efficient sonic power transmission. Subsequently, Mr. Bodine obtained additional patents directed to more focused applications of the technology.

The first published work on this technique was outlined in a 1987 Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) paper presented at the International Association of Drilling Contractors in Dallas, Texas &lt;ref&gt;O. Gonzalez, "Retrieving Stuck Liners, Tubing, Casing And Drillpipe With Vibratory Resonant Techniques" Society of Petroleum Engineers Paper # 14759&lt;/ref&gt; detailing the nature of the work and the operational results that were achieved. The cited work involving liner, tubing, and drill pipe extraction and was very successful. Reference Two&lt;ref&gt;O. Gonzalez, Henry Bernat, Paul Moore, "The Extraction of Mud Stuck Tubing Using Vibratory Resonant Techniques" Society of Petroleum Engineers Paper # 109530&lt;/ref&gt; presented at the Society of Petroleum Engineers Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition in Anaheim, California, November, 2007 explains the [[resonant]] [[vibration]] theory in more detail as well as its use in extracting long lengths of mud stuck tubulars.

=== System Dynamics of Surface Resonant Vibrators ===

Surface Resonant Vibrators rely on the principle of counter rotating eccentric weights to impart a [[sinusoidal]] [[harmonic oscillator|harmonic motion]] from the surface into the work string at the surface. Reference Three (above) provides a full explanation of this technology. The frequency of rotation, and hence [[vibration]] of the pipe string, is tuned to the [[resonant frequency]] of the system. The system is defined as the surface resonant vibrator, pipe string, fish and retaining media. The resultant forces imparted to the fish is based on the following logic:

* The delivery forces from the surface are a result of the static overpull force from the rig, plus the dynamic force component of the rotating eccentric weights
* Depending on the static overpull force component, the resultant force at the fish can be either tension or compression due to the sinusoidal force wave component from the oscillator
* Initially during startup of a vibrator, some force is necessary to lift and lower the entire load mass of the system. When the vibrator tunes to the [[resonant frequency]] of the system, the [[reaction (physics)|reactive]] load [[Impedance matching|impedance]] cancels out to zero by virtue of the [[inductance reactance]] (mass of the system) equaling the compliance or stiffness reactance (elasticity of the tubular). The remaining impedance of the system, known as the resistive load impedance, is what is retaining the stuck pipe.
* During resonant vibration, a [[Longitudinal wave|longitudinal]] sine wave travels down the pipe to the fish with an attendant pipe mass that is equal to a quarter [[wavelength]] of the [[resonant]] [[vibrating]] [[frequency]].
* A phenomenon known as [[fluidization]] of soil grains takes place during [[resonant]] [[vibration]] whereby the granular material constraining the stuck pipe is transformed into a fluidic state that offers little resistance to movement of bodies through the media. In effect, it takes on the characteristics and properties of a liquid.
* During pipe vibration, Dilation and Contraction of the pipe body, known as [[Poisson's ratio]], takes place such that when the stuck pipe is subjected to axial strain due to stretching, its diameter will contract. Similarly, when the length of pipe is compressed, its [[diameter]] will expand. Since a length of pipe undergoing vibration experiences alternate [[Tension (physics)|tensile]] and [[compressive]] forces as waves along its longitudinal axis (and therefore longitudinal strains), its [[diameter]] will expand and contract in unison with the applied tensile and compressive waves. This means that for alternate moments during a [[vibration]] cycle the pipe may actually be physically free of its bond.

The liquid component of the [[drilling mud|drilling fluid]] (known as the [[mud filtrate]], or spurt) continues to "invade" the porous and permeable formation until the solids present in the mud, commonly [[bentonite]], clog enough pores to form a [[mud cake (oil and gas)|mud cake]] capable of preventing further invasion.

If invasion is severe enough, and reservoir pressures are unable to force the fluid and associated particles out entirely when the well starts producing, the amount of oil and gas a well can produce can be permanently reduced.  This is especially true when a process called [[phase trapping]] occurs.  This is when a fluid enters a formation that is below its [[irreducible saturation]] of that fluid.  Once the fluid is present, it is held in place by capillary forces and usually can not be removed.

Invasion also has significant implications for [[well logging]].  In  many cases the "depth of investigation" of a well logging tool is only a few inches (or even less for methods such as [[sonic logging|sonic logs]]), and it is quite possible that drilling fluid has invaded beyond this depth. In these cases readings are strongly influenced by mud filtrate properties rather than pure formation (in situ) properties. This influence must be considered when interpreting the resulting logs.

{{About|the onshore oil rig|offshore oil rig|Oil platform}}
A '''drilling rig''' is an integrated system that [[Drilling|drills wells]], such as oil or water wells, in the earth's subsurface. Drilling rigs can be massive structures housing equipment used to drill water wells, oil wells, or natural gas extraction wells, or they can be small enough to be moved manually by one person and such are called [[auger (drill)|auger]]s. Drilling rigs can sample subsurface mineral deposits, test rock, soil and groundwater physical properties, and also can be used to install sub-surface fabrications, such as underground utilities, instrumentation, tunnels or wells. Drilling rigs can be mobile equipment mounted on trucks, tracks or trailers, or more permanent land or marine-based structures (such as [[oil platform]]s, commonly called 'offshore oil rigs' even if they don't contain a drilling rig). The term "rig" therefore generally refers to the complex equipment that is used to penetrate the surface of the Earth's [[continental crust|crust]].

Small to medium-sized drilling rigs are mobile, such as those used in mineral exploration drilling, blast-hole, water wells and environmental investigations. Larger rigs are capable of drilling through thousands of metres of the [[Earth]]'s crust, using large "[[mud pump]]s" to circulate [[drilling mud]] (slurry) through the [[drill bit]] and up the casing [[Annulus (oil well)|annulus]], for cooling and removing the "cuttings" while a well is drilled. Hoists in the rig can lift hundreds of [[ton]]s of [[drill pipe|pipe]]. Other equipment can force [[acid]] or sand into reservoirs to facilitate extraction of the oil or natural gas; and in remote locations there can be permanent living accommodation and catering for crews (which may be more than a hundred). Marine rigs may operate thousands of miles distant from the supply base with infrequent crew rotation or cycle.

==History==
[[File:Lingle Oil Rig.jpg|thumb|Antique drilling rig now on display at Western History Museum in Lingle, Wyoming. It was used to drill many water wells in that area—many of those wells are still in use.]]
[[Image:ZigongSaltwells.jpg|thumb|left|Antique drilling rigs in Zigong, China]]

Until [[internal combustion engine]]s were developed in the late 19th century, the main method for drilling rock was muscle power of man or animal. The technique of oil drilling through [[percussion drilling|percussion]] or [[rotary drilling]] has its origins dating back to the ancient Chinese Han Dynasty in 500 BC, where percussion drilling was used to extract natural gas in the Sichuan province.&lt;ref name="Smil 2017"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Oil - A Beginner's Guide |last= Smil  |first=Vaclav |publisher=Oneworld Publications |year=2017 |isbn=978-1786072863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early oil and gas drilling methods were seemingly primitive as it required several technical skills.&lt;ref name="Smil 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heshelow 2010 52"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Investing in Oil and Gas: The ABC's of DPPs |last=Heshelow  |first=Kathy  |publisher=Iuniverse |year=2010 |isbn=978-1450261715 |pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The skills involved the availability of heavy iron bits and long bamboo poles, the manufacturing of long and sturdy cables woven from bamboo fiber, and levers. Heavy iron bits were attached to long bamboo cables suspended from bamboo derricks and then were repeatedly raised and dropped into a manually dug hole by having two to six men jumping on a lever.&lt;ref name="Smil 2017"/&gt; Han dynasty oil wells made by percussion drilling was effective but only reached 10 meters deep and 100 meters by the 10th century.&lt;ref name="Smil 2017"/&gt; By the 16th century, the Chinese were exploring and drilling oil wells more than 2000 feet deep.&lt;ref name="Heshelow 2010 52"/&gt; A modernized variant of the ancient Chinese drilling technique was used by American businessman [[Edwin Drake]] to drill Pennsylvania's first oil well in 1859 using small steam engines to power the drilling process rather than by human muscle.&lt;ref name="Smil 2017"/&gt;

In the 1970s, outside of the oil and gas industry, roller bits using mud circulation were replaced by the first pneumatic reciprocating piston Reverse Circulation (RC) drills, and became essentially obsolete for most shallow drilling, and are now only used in certain situations where rocks preclude other methods. RC drilling proved much faster and more efficient, and continues to improve with better metallurgy, deriving harder, more durable bits, and compressors delivering higher air pressures at higher volumes, enabling deeper and faster penetration. Diamond drilling has remained essentially unchanged since its inception.

==Petroleum drilling industry==
[[Petroleum|Oil]] and [[natural gas]] drilling rigs are used not only to identify geologic reservoirs but also to create holes that allow the extraction of oil or natural gas from those reservoirs. Primarily in onshore oil and gas fields once a well has been drilled, the drilling rig will be moved off of the well and a service rig (a smaller rig) that is purpose-built for completions will be moved on to the well to get the well on line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baars|first=D.L.|title=Petroleum; a primer for Kansas|year=1989|publisher=Kansas Geological Survey|page=40|url=http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Publications/Oil/primer12.html|edition=Educational Series, no. 7|author2=Watney, W.L. |author3=Steeples, D.W. |author4= Brostuen, E.A |accessdate=18 April 2011|quote=After the cementing of the casing has been completed, the drilling rig, equipment, and materials are removed from the drill site. A smaller rig, known as a workover rig or completion rig, is moved over the well bore. The smaller rig is used for the remaining completion operations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This frees up the drilling rig to drill another hole and streamlines the operation as well as allowing for specialization of certain services, i.e. completions vs. drilling.

==Mining drilling industry==
[[Mining]] drilling rigs are used for two main purposes, exploration drilling which aims to identify the location and quality of a mineral, and production drilling, used in the production-cycle for mining. Drilling rigs used for [[rock blasting]] for surface mines vary in size dependent on the size of the hole desired, and is typically classified into smaller pre-split and larger production holes. [[Underground mining (hard rock)]] uses a variety of drill rigs dependent on the desired purpose, such as production, bolting, cabling, and tunnelling.

==Mobile drilling rigs==
[[File:Mercedes Benz Atego - Bohranlage (1).jpg|thumbnail|Mobile drilling rig mounted on a truck]]
In early oil exploration, drilling rigs were semi-permanent in nature and the derricks were often built on site and left in place after the completion of the well. In more recent times drilling rigs are expensive custom-built machines that can be moved from well to well. Some light duty drilling rigs are like a mobile crane and are more usually used to drill water wells. Larger land rigs must be broken apart into sections and loads to move to a new place, a process which can often take weeks.

Small mobile drilling rigs are also used to drill or bore [[Deep foundation|piles]]. Rigs can range from 100 [[ton]] [[continuous flight auger]] (CFA) rigs to small air powered rigs used to drill holes in quarries, etc. These rigs use the same technology and equipment as the oil drilling rigs, just on a smaller scale.

The drilling mechanisms outlined below differ mechanically in terms of the machinery used, but also in terms of the method by which drill cuttings are removed from the cutting face of the drill and returned to surface.

==Drilling rig classification==
There are many types and designs of drilling rigs, with many drilling rigs capable of switching or combining different drilling technologies as needed. Drilling rigs can be described using any of the following attributes:

===By power used===
* Mechanical&amp;nbsp;— the rig uses torque converters, clutches, and transmissions powered by its own engines, often diesel
* Electric&amp;nbsp;— the major items of machinery are driven by electric motors, usually with power generated on-site using internal combustion engines
* Hydraulic&amp;nbsp;— the rig primarily uses hydraulic power
* Pneumatic&amp;nbsp;— the rig is primarily powered by pressurized air
* Steam&amp;nbsp;— the rig uses steam-powered engines and pumps (obsolete after middle of 20th century.)

===By pipe used===
* Cable&amp;nbsp;— a braided hemp or wire rope is used to raise and drop the [[drill bit]]
* Conventional&amp;nbsp;— uses metal or plastic [[drill pipe]] of varying types
* [[Coil tubing]]&amp;nbsp;— uses a single flexible tube of sufficient length, stored on a drum up to five metres in diameter, and a downhole drilling motor
* Chain&amp;nbsp;— a chain is used to raise and drop the drill bit in some hydraulic rigs

===By height===
''Rigs are differentiated by height based on how many connected joints of [[drill pipe]] they are able to "stand" in the derrick when it is out of the hole. Typically this is done when changing a drill bit or when "logging" the well. A single joint of pipe is typically some 30 feet long.''

* Single&amp;nbsp;— can hold only single drill pipes. The presence or absence of vertical pipe racking "fingers" varies from rig to rig.
* Double&amp;nbsp;— derrick can hold two connected drill pipes, called a "double stand" or simply a "double".
* Triple&amp;nbsp;— derrick can hold three connected drill pipes: a "triple stand" or "thribble".
* Quadri&amp;nbsp;— can hold four connected drill pipes, called a "quadri stand" or "fourble". Derricks of this size are uncommon.

===By method of rotation or drilling method===
* No-rotation includes direct push rigs and most service rigs
* [[Rotary table (drilling rig)|Rotary table]]&amp;nbsp;— rotation is achieved by turning a square or hexagonal pipe (the "Kelly") in a ''rotary table'' at drill floor level.
* [[Top drive]]&amp;nbsp;— rotation and circulation is done at the top of the drill string, on a motor that moves in a track along the derrick. This is the design of the most modern rigs.
* Sonic&amp;nbsp;— uses primarily vibratory energy to advance the drill string
* Hammer&amp;nbsp;— uses rotation and percussive force (see [[Down-the-hole drill]])

===By position of derrick===
* Conventional&amp;nbsp;— [[derrick]] is vertical
* Slant&amp;nbsp;— [[derrick]] is slanted at a 45 degree angle to facilitate horizontal drilling

===Directional drilling (DD)===
Directional drilling is done with a mud motor on the Bottom hole assembly (BHA). The direction is controlled by wireless controller to drill the hole in any way that the driller requires. This is the future of drilling.

==Drilling Techniques==
There are a variety of drilling techniques which can be used to drill a [[borehole]] into the ground. Each has its advantages and disadvantages, in terms of the depth to what it can drill, the type of sample returned, the costs involved and penetration rates achieved. Some types included are Rotary cut, Rotary Abrasive, Rotary Reverse, Cable Tooling, and Sonic Drilling.

===Auger drilling===
Auger drilling is done with a [[Helix|helical]] screw which is driven into the ground with rotation; the earth is lifted up the borehole by the blade of the screw. Hollow stem auger drilling is used for softer ground such as swamps where the hole will not stay open by itself for environmental drilling, geotechnical drilling, [[soil]] [[engineering]] and [[geochemistry]] reconnaissance work in exploration for [[mineral]] deposits. Solid flight augers/bucket augers are used in harder ground construction drilling. In some cases, [[mining|mine]] shafts are dug with auger drills. Small augers can be mounted on the back of a utility truck, with large augers used for sinking piles for bridge foundations.

Auger drilling is restricted to soil, soft unconsolidated formations, or weak weathered [[Rock (geology)|rock]]. It is cheap and fast.

===Percussion rotary air blast drilling (RAB)===
RAB drilling is used most frequently in the mineral exploration industry. (This tool is also known as a [[Down-the-hole drill]].) The drill uses a pneumatic reciprocating piston-driven "hammer" to energetically drive a heavy drill bit into the rock. The drill bit is hollow, solid steel and has ~20&amp;nbsp;mm thick tungsten rods protruding from the steel matrix as "buttons". The tungsten buttons are the cutting face of the bit.

The cuttings are blown up the outside of the rods and collected at surface. [[Air]] or a combination of air and [[foam]] lift the cuttings.

RAB drilling is used primarily for [[mineral]] [[Prospecting|exploration]], water bore drilling and blast-hole drilling in mines, as well as for other applications such as engineering, etc. RAB produces lower quality samples because the cuttings are blown up the outside of the rods and can be contaminated from contact with other rocks.
RAB drilling at extreme depth, if it encounters water, may rapidly clog the outside of the hole with debris, precluding removal of drill cuttings from the hole. This can be counteracted, however, with the use of "stabilizers" also known as "reamers", which are large cylindrical pieces of steel attached to the drill string, and made to perfectly fit the size of the hole being drilled. These have sets of rollers on the side, usually with tungsten buttons, that constantly break down cuttings being pushed upwards.

The use of high-powered air compressors, which push 900-1150&amp;nbsp;cfm of air at 300-350&amp;nbsp;psi down the hole also ensures drilling of a deeper hole up to ~1250&amp;nbsp;m due to higher air pressure which pushes all rock cuttings and any water to the surface. This, of course, is all dependent on the density and weight of the rock being drilled, and on how worn the drill bit is.

===Air core drilling===
Air core drilling and related methods use hardened [[steel]] or [[tungsten]] blades to bore a hole into unconsolidated ground. The drill bit has three blades arranged around the bit head, which cut the unconsolidated ground. The rods are hollow and contain an inner tube which sits inside the hollow outer rod barrel. The drill cuttings are removed by injection of compressed air into the hole via the annular area between the innertube and the drill rod. The cuttings are then blown back to surface up the inner tube where they pass through the sample separating system and are collected if needed. Drilling continues with the addition of rods to the top of the drill string. Air core drilling can occasionally produce small chunks of cored rock.

This method of drilling is used to drill the weathered [[regolith]], as the drill rig and steel or tungsten blades cannot penetrate fresh rock. Where possible, air core drilling is preferred over RAB drilling as it provides a more representative sample. Air core drilling can achieve depths approaching 300 metres in good conditions. As the cuttings are removed inside the rods and are less prone to contamination compared to conventional drilling where the cuttings pass to the surface via outside return between the outside of the drill rod and the walls of the hole. This method is more costly and slower than RAB.

===Cable tool drilling===
[[Image:Well spudder 8606.jpg|thumb|upright|Cable tool water well drilling rig in West Virginia. These slow rigs have mostly been replaced by rotary drilling rigs in the U.S.]]
Cable tool rigs are a traditional way of drilling [[water well]]s. The majority of large diameter water supply wells, especially deep wells completed in [[bedrock]] [[aquifers]], were completed using this drilling method. Although this drilling method has largely been supplanted in recent years by other, faster drilling techniques, it is still the most feasible drilling method for large diameter, deep bedrock wells, and in widespread use for small rural water supply wells. The impact of the drill bit fractures the rock and in many shale rock situations increases the water flow into a well over rotary.

Also known as [[Ballistics|ballistic]] well drilling and sometimes called "spudders", these rigs raise and drop a drill string with a heavy [[carbide]] tipped drilling bit that chisels through the rock by finely pulverizing the subsurface materials. The drill string is composed of the upper drill rods, a set of "jars" (inter-locking "sliders" that help transmit additional energy to the drill bit and assist in removing the bit if it is stuck) and the [[drill bit]]. During the drilling process, the drill string is periodically removed from the borehole and a [[bailer]] is lowered to collect the drill cuttings (rock fragments, soil, etc.). The bailer is a bucket-like tool with a trapdoor in the base. If the borehole is dry, water is added so that the drill cuttings will flow into the bailer. When lifted, the trapdoor closes and the cuttings are then raised and removed. Since the drill string must be raised and lowered to advance the boring, the casing (larger diameter outer piping) is typically used to hold back upper soil materials and stabilize the borehole.

Cable tool rigs are simpler and cheaper than similarly sized rotary rigs, although loud and very slow to operate. The world record cable tool well was drilled in New York to a depth of almost {{convert|12,000|ft|m}}. The common [[Bucyrus-Erie]] 22 can drill down to about {{convert|1,100|ft|m}}. Since cable tool drilling does not use air to eject the drilling chips like a rotary, instead using a cable strung bailer, technically there is no limitation on depth.

Cable tool rigs now are nearly obsolete in the United States. They are mostly used in Africa or Third-World countries. Being slow, cable tool rig drilling means increased wages for drillers. In the United States drilling wages would average around US$200 per day per man, while in Africa it is only US$6 per day per man, so a slow drilling machine can still be used in undeveloped countries with depressed wages. A cable tool rig can drill {{convert|25|ft|m}} to {{convert|60|ft|m}} of hard rock a day. A newer rotary drillcat top head rig equipped with down-the-hole (DTH) hammer can drill {{convert|500|ft|m}} or more per day, depending on size and formation hardness.

===Reverse circulation (RC) drilling===
[[Image:RC Rig sideview.jpg|thumb|RC Drill Rig Sideview|right|Track mounted Reverse Circulation rig (side view).]]
[[File:L23VTx119ft HHH16 BHD40 Kobelco CK1800 Crane France.jpg|left|thumb|Reverse Circulation Drilling set-up on Vertical Travel Leads at the Port of La Rochelle, France]]
RC drilling is similar to air core drilling, in that the drill cuttings are returned to surface inside the rods. The drilling mechanism is a [[pneumatic]] reciprocating piston known as a "hammer" driving a tungsten-steel drill bit. RC drilling utilises much larger rigs and machinery and depths of up to 500 metres are routinely achieved. RC drilling ideally produces dry rock chips, as large air [[gas compressor|compressors]] dry the rock out ahead of the advancing drill bit. RC drilling is slower and costlier but achieves better penetration than RAB or air core drilling; it is cheaper than diamond coring and is thus preferred for most [[mineral exploration]] work.

Reverse circulation is achieved by blowing air down the rods, the differential pressure creating [[airlift pump|air lift]] of the water and cuttings up the "inner tube", which is inside each rod. It reaches the "divertor" at the top of the hole, then moves through a sample hose which is attached to the top of the "cyclone". The drill cuttings travel around the inside of the cyclone until they fall through an opening at the bottom and are collected in a sample bag.

The most commonly used RC drill bits are 5-8&amp;nbsp;inches (13–20&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter and have round tungsten 'buttons' that protrude from the bit, which are required to drill through [[shale]] and abrasive rock. As the buttons wear down, drilling becomes slower and the rod string can potentially become bogged in the hole. This is a problem as trying to recover the rods may take hours and in some cases weeks. The rods and drill bits themselves are very expensive, often resulting in great cost to drilling companies when equipment is lost down the bore hole. Most companies will regularly re-grind the buttons on their drill bits in order to prevent this, and to speed up progress. Usually, when something is lost (breaks off) in the hole, it is not the drill string, but rather from the bit, hammer, or stabilizer to the bottom of the drill string (bit). This is usually caused by operator error, over-stressed metal, or adverse drilling conditions causing downhole equipment to get stuck in a part of the hole.

Although RC drilling is air-powered, water is also used to reduce dust, keep the drill bit cool, and assist in pushing cutting back upwards, but also when "collaring" a new hole. A [[Drilling mud|mud]] called "Liqui-Pol" is mixed with water and pumped into the rod string, down the hole. This helps to bring up the sample to the surface by making the sand stick together. Occasionally, "Super-Foam" (a.k.a. "Quik-Foam") is also used, to bring all the very fine cuttings to the surface, and to clean the hole. When the drill reaches hard rock, a "collar" is put down the hole around the rods, which is normally PVC piping. Occasionally the collar may be made from metal casing. Collaring a hole is needed to stop the walls from caving in and bogging the rod string at the top of the hole. Collars may be up to 60 metres deep, depending on the ground, although if drilling through hard rock a collar may not be necessary.

Reverse circulation rig setups usually consist of a support vehicle, an auxiliary vehicle, as well as the rig itself. The support vehicle, normally a truck, holds diesel and water tanks for resupplying the rig. It also holds other supplies needed for maintenance on the rig. The auxiliary is a vehicle, carrying an auxiliary engine and a booster engine. These engines are connected to the rig by high pressure air hoses. Although RC rigs have their own booster and [[Air compressor|compressor]] to generate air pressure, extra power is needed which usually isn't supplied by the rig due to lack of space for these large engines. Instead, the engines are mounted on the auxiliary vehicle. Compressors on an RC rig have an output of around 1000 [[cubic feet per minute|cfm]] at 500 [[pound-force per square inch|psi]] (500&amp;nbsp;L·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; at 3.4&amp;nbsp;MPa). Alternatively, stand-alone air compressors which have an output of 900-1150cfm at 300-350 psi each are used in sets of 2, 3, or 4, which are all routed to the rig through a multi-valve manifold.

===Diamond core drilling===
[[Image:Layne Rig57.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Multi-combination drilling rig (capable of both [[diamond core drill|diamond]] and reverse circulation drilling). Rig is currently set up for diamond drilling.]]

[[Diamond core drill]]ing ([[exploration diamond drilling]]) utilizes an annular diamond-impregnated drill bit attached to the end of hollow drill rods to cut a cylindrical core of solid rock. The diamonds used to make diamond core bits are a variety of sizes, fine to microfine industrial grade [[diamond]]s, and the ratio of diamonds to metal used in the matrix affects the performance of the bits cutting ability in different types of rock formations. The [[diamond]]s are set within a matrix of varying hardness, from [[brass]] to high-grade steel. Matrix hardness, diamond size and dosing can be varied according to the rock which must be cut.  The bits made with hard steel with a low diamond count are ideal for softer highly fractured rock while others made of softer steels and high diamond ratio are good for coring in hard solid rock. Holes within the bit allow water to be delivered to the cutting face. This provides three essential functions&amp;nbsp;— lubrication, cooling, and removal of drill cuttings from the hole.

Diamond drilling is much slower than reverse circulation (RC) drilling due to the hardness of the ground being drilled. Drilling of 1200 to 1800 metres is common and at these depths, ground is mainly hard rock. Techniques vary among drill operators and what the rig they are using is capable of, some diamond rigs need to drill slowly to lengthen the life of drill bits and rods, which are very expensive and time consuming to replace at extremely deep depths. As a diamond drill rig cores deeper and deeper the time consuming part of the process is not cutting 5 to 10 more feet of rock core but the retrieval of the core with the wire line &amp; overshot tool.
[[Core sample]]s are retrieved via the use of a core tube, a hollow tube placed inside the rod string and pumped with water until it locks into the core barrel. As the core is drilled, the core barrel slides over the core as it is cut. An "overshot" attached to the end of the winch cable is lowered inside the rod string and locks on to the backend (aka head assembly), located on the top end of the core barrel. The winch is retracted, pulling the core tube to the surface. The core does not drop out of the inside of the core tube when lifted because either a split ring core lifter or basket retainer allow the core to move into, but not back out of the tube.

[[File:Atlas Copco core bits.jpg|thumb|right|Diamond core drill bits]]
Once the core tube is removed from the hole, the core sample is then removed from the core tube and catalogued. The Driller's assistant unscrews the backend off the core tube using tube wrenches, then each part of the tube is taken and the core is shaken out into core trays. The core is washed, measured and broken into smaller pieces using a hammer or sawn through to make it fit into the sample trays. Once catalogued, the core trays are retrieved by geologists who then analyse the core and determine if the drill site is a good location to expand future mining operations.

Diamond rigs can also be part of a multi-combination rig. Multi-combination rigs are a dual setup rig capable of operating in either a reverse circulation (RC) and diamond drilling role (though not at the same time). This is a common scenario where exploration drilling is being performed in a very isolated location. The rig is first set up to drill as an RC rig and once the desired metres are drilled, the rig is set up for diamond drilling. This way the deeper metres of the hole can be drilled without moving the rig and waiting for a diamond rig to set up on the [[Drill floor|pad]].

===Direct push rigs===
Direct push technology includes several types of drilling rigs and drilling equipment which advances a drill string by pushing or hammering without rotating the drill string. While this does not meet the proper definition of drilling, it does achieve the same result&amp;nbsp;— a [[borehole]]. Direct push rigs include both [[cone penetration test]]ing (CPT) rigs and direct push sampling rigs such as a [[PowerProbe]] or [[Geoprobe]]. Direct push rigs typically are limited to drilling in unconsolidated soil materials and very soft rock.

CPT rigs advance specialized testing equipment (such as electronic cones), and soil samplers using large hydraulic rams. Most CPT rigs are heavily ballasted (20 metric tons is typical) as a counter force against the pushing force of the hydraulic rams which are often rated up to 20&amp;nbsp;kN. Alternatively, small, light CPT rigs and offshore CPT rigs will use [[anchors]] such as screwed-in ground anchors to create the reactive force. In ideal conditions, CPT rigs can achieve production rates of up to 250–300 meters per day.

Direct push drilling rigs use hydraulic cylinders and a hydraulic hammer in advancing a hollow core sampler to gather soil and groundwater samples. The speed and depth of penetration is largely dependent on the soil type, the size of the sampler, and the weight and power of the rig. Direct push techniques are generally limited to shallow soil sample recovery in unconsolidated soil materials. The advantage of direct push technology is that in the right soil type it can produce a large number of high quality samples quickly and cheaply, generally from 50 to 75 meters per day. Rather than hammering, direct push can also be combined with sonic (vibratory) methods to increase drill efficiency.

===Hydraulic rotary drilling===
[[Oil well]] drilling utilises tri-cone roller, carbide embedded, fixed-cutter diamond, or diamond-impregnated drill bits to wear away at the cutting face. This is preferred because there is no need to return intact samples to surface for assay as the objective is to reach a formation containing oil or natural gas. Sizable machinery is used, enabling depths of several kilometres to be penetrated. Rotating hollow drill pipes carry down [[bentonite]] and [[barite]] infused [[drilling mud]]s to lubricate, cool, and clean the [[Well drilling|drilling bit]], control downhole pressures, stabilize the wall of the [[borehole]] and remove [[drill cuttings]]. The mud travels back to the surface around the outside of the drill pipe, called the [[annulus (oil well)|annulus]]. Examining rock chips extracted from the mud is known as [[mud logging]]. Another form of [[Formation evaluation|well logging]] is electronic and is commonly employed to evaluate the existence of possible oil and gas deposits in the [[borehole]]. This can take place while the well is being drilled, using [[Measurement While Drilling]] tools, or after drilling, by [[Well logging|lowering measurement tools]] into the newly drilled hole.

The rotary system of drilling was in general use in Texas in the early 1900s. It is a modification of one invented by Fauvelle in 1845, and used in the early years of the oil industry in some of the oil-producing countries in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Petroleum |volume=21 |pages=316–323 |first=Boverton |last=Redwood|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally pressurized water was used instead of mud, and was almost useless in hard rock before the diamond cutting bit.

The drilling and production of oil and gas can pose a [[safety]] risk and a hazard to the [[Natural environment|environment]] from the ignition of the entrained gas causing dangerous fires and also from the risk of oil leakage polluting water, land and groundwater. For these reasons, redundant safety systems and highly trained personnel are required by law in all countries with significant production.

==Automated drill rig==
An automated drill rig (ADR) is an automated full-sized walking land-based drill rig that drills long lateral sections in horizontal wells for the oil and gas industry.&lt;ref name="New Tech" /&gt;  ADRs are agile rigs that can move from pad to pad to new well sites faster than other full-sized drilling rigs. Each rig costs about  $25 million. ADR is used extensively in the [[Athabasca oil sands]]. According to the "Oil Patch Daily News", "Each rig will generate 50,000 man-hours of work during the construction phase and upon completion, each operating rig will directly and indirectly employ more than 100 workers." Compared to conventional drilling rigs", Ensign, an international oilfield services contractor based in Calgary, Alberta, that makes ADRs claims that they are "safer to operate,  have "enhanced controls intelligence," "reduced environmental footprint, quick mobility and advanced communications between field and office."&lt;ref name="New Tech"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.newtechmagazine.com/index.php/oilpatch-daily-news/drilling/11331-ensign-launches-newest-and-most-powerful-automated-adr-1500s-pad-drill-rigs-in-montney-play |title=Ensign Launches Newest And Most Powerful Automated ADR 1500S Pad Drill Rigs In Montney Play |date=21 November 2014 |accessdate=6 December 2014 |work=New Tech Magazine |location=Calgary, Alberta |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210131127/http://www.newtechmagazine.com/index.php/oilpatch-daily-news/drilling/11331-ensign-launches-newest-and-most-powerful-automated-adr-1500s-pad-drill-rigs-in-montney-play |archivedate=10 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2005 the first specifically designed slant automated drilling rig (ADR), Ensign Rig No. 118, for [[steam assisted gravity drainage]] (SAGD) applications was mobilized by Deer Creek Energy Limited, a Calgary-based oilsands company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newtechmagazine.com/index.php/daily-news/archived-news/3699-deer-creek-and-ensign-spud-first-sagd-wells-using-slant-automated-drilling-rig |title=Deer Creek And Ensign Spud First SAGD Wells Using Slant Automated Drilling Rig |work=newtechmagazine.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210131220/http://www.newtechmagazine.com/index.php/daily-news/archived-news/3699-deer-creek-and-ensign-spud-first-sagd-wells-using-slant-automated-drilling-rig |archivedate=2014-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limits of the technology==
Drill technology has advanced steadily since the 19th century. However, there are several basic limiting factors which will determine the depth to which a bore hole can be sunk.

All holes must maintain outer diameter; the diameter of the hole must remain wider than the diameter of the rods or the rods cannot turn in the hole and progress cannot continue. Friction caused by the drilling operation will tend to reduce the outside diameter of the drill bit. This applies to all drilling methods, except that in diamond core drilling the use of thinner rods and casing may permit the hole to continue. Casing is simply a hollow sheath which protects the hole against collapse during drilling, and is made of metal or [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]. Often diamond holes will start off at a large diameter and when outside diameter is lost, thinner rods put down inside casing to continue, until finally the hole becomes too narrow. Alternatively, the hole can be reamed; this is the usual practice in oil well drilling where the hole size is maintained down to the next casing point.

For percussion techniques, the main limitation is air pressure. Air must be delivered to the piston at sufficient pressure to activate the reciprocating action, and in turn drive the head into the rock with sufficient strength to fracture and pulverise it. With depth, volume is added to the in-rod string, requiring larger compressors to achieve operational pressures. Secondly, [[groundwater]] is ubiquitous, and increases in [[pressure]] with depth in the ground. The air inside the rod string must be pressurised enough to overcome this water pressure at the bit face. Then, the air must be able to carry the rock fragments to surface. This is why depths in excess of 500 m for reverse circulation drilling are rarely achieved, because the cost is prohibitive and approaches the threshold at which diamond core drilling is more economic.

Diamond drilling can routinely achieve depths in excess of 1200 m. In cases where money is no issue, extreme depths have been achieved, because there is no requirement to overcome water pressure. However, water circulation must be maintained to return the drill cuttings to surface, and more importantly to maintain cooling and lubrication of the cutting surface of the bit; while at the same time reduce friction on the steel walls of the rods turning against the rock walls of the hole. When water return is lost the rods will vibrate, this is called "rod chatter", and that will damage the drill rods, and crack the joints.

Without sufficient lubrication and cooling, the matrix of the drill bit will soften. While diamond is the hardest substance known, at 10 on the [[Mohs hardness scale]], it must remain firmly in the matrix to achieve cutting. Weight on bit, the force exerted on the cutting face of the bit by the drill rods in the hole above the bit, must also be monitored.

A unique drilling operation in deep ocean water was named [[Project Mohole]].

Research includes technologies based on the utilization of [[Water jet cutter|water jet]], [[Plasma (physics)|chemical plasma]], [[Spallation|hydrothermal spallation]] or [[laser]].

==Causes of deviation==
Most drill holes deviate slightly from their planned trajectory. This is because of the torque of the turning bit working against the cutting face, because of the flexibility of the steel rods and especially the screw joints, because of reaction to [[foliation (geology)|foliation]] and structure within the rock, and because of [[refraction]] as the bit moves into different rock layers of varying resistance. Additionally, inclined holes will tend to deviate upwards because the drill rods will lie against the bottom of the bore, causing the drill bit to be slightly inclined from true. It is because of deviation that drill holes must be surveyed if deviation will impact the usefulness of the information returned. Sometimes the surface location can be offset laterally to take advantage of the expected deviation tendency, so the bottom of the hole will end up near the desired location.  Oil well drilling commonly uses a process of controlled deviation called [[directional drilling]] (e.g., when several wells are drilled from one surface location).

==Rig equipment==
[[Image:Oil Rig NT8.svg|thumb|Simple diagram of a drilling rig and its basic operation]]Drilling rigs typically include at least some of the following items: See [[Drilling rig (petroleum)]] for a more detailed description.

*[[Blowout preventer]]s: (BOPs)
The equipment associated with a rig is to some extent dependent on the type of rig but (#23 &amp; #24) are devices installed at the wellhead to prevent fluids and gases from unintentionally escaping from the [[borehole]]. #23 is the annular (often referred to as the "Hydril", which is one manufacturer) and #24 is the [[pipe rams]] and [[blind rams]].  In the place of #24 [[Variable bore rams]] or VBRs can be used.  These offer the same pressure and sealing capacity found in standard pipe rams, while offering the versatility of sealing on various sizes of drill pipe, production tubing and casing without changing standard pipe rams.  Normally VBRs are used when utilizing a tapered drill string (when different size drill pipe is used in the complete drill string).
*[[Centrifuge]]: an industrial version of the device that separates fine silt and sand from the drilling fluid.
*[[Solids control]]: solids control equipment is for preparing drilling mud for the drilling rig.
*[[Chain tong]]s: wrench with a section of chain, that wraps around whatever is being tightened or loosened. Similar to a pipe wrench.
*[[Degasser]]: a device that separates air and/or gas from the [[drilling fluid]].
*[[Desander]] / [[desilter]]: contains a set of [[hydrocyclone]]s that separate sand and silt from the drilling fluid.
*[[Drawworks]]: (#7) is the mechanical section that contains the spool, whose main function is to reel in/out the drill line to raise/lower the [[traveling block]] (#11).
*[[Drill bit (well)|Drill bit]]: (#26) is a device attached to the end of the drill string that breaks apart the rock being drilled. It contains jets through which the drilling fluid exits.
*[[Drill pipe]]: (#16) joints of hollow tubing used to connect the surface equipment to the [[bottom hole assembly]] (BHA) and acts as a conduit for the [[drilling fluid]]. In the diagram, these are "stands" of drill pipe which are 2 or 3 joints of drill pipe connected together and "stood" in the derrick vertically, usually to save time while [[Tripping (pipe)|tripping pipe]].
*[[Elevators (drilling rig)|Elevators]]: a gripping device that is used to latch to the drill pipe or casing to facilitate the lowering or lifting (of pipe or casing) into or out of the [[borehole]].
*[[Mud motor]]: a hydraulically powered device positioned just above the [[Drilling bit#Well drilling bits|drill bit]] used to spin the bit independently from the rest of the drill string.
*[[Mud pump]]: (#4) reciprocal type of pump used to circulate drilling fluid through the system.
*[[Mud tank]]s: (#1) often called mud pits, provides a reserve store of drilling fluid until it is required down the wellbore.
*[[Rotary table (drilling rig)|Rotary table]]: (#20) rotates the drill string along with the attached tools and bit.
*[[Shale shaker]]: (#2) separates [[drill cuttings]] from the drilling fluid before it is pumped back down the [[borehole]].

== Occupational safety ==
Drilling rigs create some safety challenges for those who work on them. One safety concern is the use of [[seatbelt]]s for workers driving between two locations. Motor vehicle fatalities on the job for these workers is 8.5 times the rate of the rest of the US working population, which can be attributed to the low rate of seatbelt use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2013/08/07/super-workplace/ |title = The Importance of Occupational Safety and Health: Making for a "Super" Workplace |date = 7 August 2013 |accessdate = 16 January 2015 |publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |first1 = Jaclyn |last1 = Krah |first2 = Richard L. |last2 = Unger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[reflection seismology]], a '''flat spot''' is a [[seismic attribute]] anomaly that appears as a horizontal reflector cutting across the [[stratigraphy]] elsewhere present on the seismic image.&lt;ref name="Gluyas"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Gluyas, J. |author2=Swarbrick, R. | year=2011 | title=Petroleum Geoscience |edition=2nd | publisher=Blackwell Publishing | isbn=978-0-632-03767-4|page= 242}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its appearance can indicate the presence of [[hydrocarbons]].  Therefore, it is known as a [[direct hydrocarbon indicator]] and is used by [[geophysicists]] in [[hydrocarbon exploration]].

==Theory==
A flat spot can result from the increase in [[acoustic impedance]] when a gas-filled porous rock (with a lower acoustic impedance) overlies a liquid-filled porous rock (with a higher acoustic impedance).  It may stand out on a seismic image because it is flat and will contrast with surrounding dipping reflections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Sheriff, R. E. |author2=Geldart, L. P. | year=1995 | title=Exploration Seismology |edition=2nd | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=0-521-46826-4 |page= 416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caution==
There are a number of other possible reasons for there being a flat spot on a seismic image.  It could be representative of a mineralogical change in the subsurface or an unresolved shallower multiple.  Additionally, the interpretation of a flat spot should be attempted after [[depth conversion]] to confirm that the anomaly is actually flat.&lt;ref name="Gluyas"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5119">In the field of [[formation evaluation]], [[porosity]] is one of the key measurements to quantify oil and gas reserves. '''Neutron porosity''' measurement employs a neutron source to measure the hydrogen index in a reservoir, which is directly related to porosity. The Hydrogen Index (HI) of a material is defined as the ratio of the concentration of hydrogen atoms per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in the material, to that of pure water at 75&amp;nbsp;°F. As hydrogen atoms are present in both water and oil filled reservoirs, measurement of the amount allows estimation of the amount of liquid-filled porosity.

==Physics==
[[File:NeutronEnergyDecay.gif|thumb|Fig1: Neutron Energy Decay]]

Neutrons are typically emitted by a radioactive source such as Americium Beryllium (Am-Be) or Plutonium Beryllium (Pu-Be), or generated by electronic [[neutron generator]]s such as minitron. Fast neutrons are emitted by these sources with energy ranges from 4 MeV to 14 MeV, and inelastically interact with matter. Once slowed down to 2 MeV, they start to scatter elastically and slow down further until the neutrons reach a thermal energy level of about 0.025 eV. When thermal neutrons are then absorbed, gamma rays are emitted. A suitable detector, positioned at a certain distance from the source, can measure either epithermal neutron population, thermal neutron population, or the gamma rays emitted after the absorption. 

Mechanics of elastic collisions predict that the maximum energy transfer occurs during collisions of two particles of equal mass. Therefore, a hydrogen atom (H) will cause a neutron to slow down the most, as they are of roughly equal mass. As hydrogen is fundamentally associated to the amount of water and/or oil present in the pore space, measurement of neutron population within the investigated volume is directly linked to porosity.

==Correction==
Determination of porosity is one of the most important uses of neutron porosity log. Correction parameters for [[lithology]], borehole parameters, and others are necessary for accurate porosity determination as follow:
# Borehole size
# Borehole salinity
# Borehole temperature and pressure
# Mud cake
# Mud weight
# Formation salinity
# Tool standoff from borehole wall

==Interpretation==
Subject to various assumptions and corrections, values of apparent porosity can be derived from any neutron log. One can not underestimate the slow down of neutrons by other elements even if they are less effective. Certain effects, such as lithology, clay content, and amount and type of hydrocarbons, can be recognized and corrected for only if additional porosity information is available, for example from sonic and/or density log. Any interpretation of a neutron log alone should be undertaken with a realization of the uncertainties involved.

===Effect of light hydrocarbon and gas===
The quantitative response of neutron tool to gas or light hydrocarbon depends primarily on hydrogen index and "excavation effect". The hydrogen index can be estimated from the composition and density of the hydrocarbons

Given a fixed volume, gas has considerably lower hydrogen concentration. When pore spaces in the rock are excavated and replaced with gas, the formation has smaller neutron-slowing characteristic, hence the terms "Excavation Effect". If this effect is ignored, a neutron log will show a low porosity value. This characteristic allows a neutron porosity log to be used with other porosity logs (such as a density log) to detect gas zones and identify gas-liquid contacts.

==Measurement technique==
Neutron tools are based on the measurement of a neutron cloud of different energy levels within the investigated volume. Epithermal-neutron tools measure epithermal neutron density with energy levels between 100eV and 0.1eV in the formation. Thermal-neutron tools only measure the population of neutrons with a thermal energy level, and Neutron-gamma tools measure the intensity of gamma flux generated by thermal neutron capture. The tools usually have two detectors (or more) with different spacings from the source to produce ratio of count rates, which theoretically reduce borehole effects.

A Helium-3 (He-3) filled proportional counter is the most common epithermal and thermal neutron detector. Helium has a high neutron capture cross section and produces the following reaction when interacting with a neutron.

    &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He + &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;n  →   &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H + &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H + 764keV energy

To boost the charge produced by the interaction between Helium and a Neutron, a high voltage is applied to the anode of the counter. A high operating voltage is chosen to give enough gain for counting purposes. Most Helium-3 counters use a quench gas to stabilize high voltage performance and prevent run-away.

{{Well logging}}
[[File:Gama Ray Log.GIF|thumb|right|Example gamma ray log. Blue and black lines indicate the measured gamma rays. Sand section of interest is located at bottom of log where the log moves to the left.]]
'''Gamma ray logging''' is a method of measuring naturally occurring [[gamma radiation]] to characterize the rock or sediment in a [[borehole]] or drill hole.  It is a wireline logging method used in mining, mineral exploration, water-well drilling, for [[formation evaluation]] in oil and gas well drilling and for other related purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slb.com/services/evaluation/wireline_open_hole/petrophysics/gamma_ray/gamma_ray_tools.aspx GR-Logging Tools] by Schlumberger for the Oil and Gas Industry&lt;/ref&gt;  Different types of rock emit different amounts and different spectra of natural [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]].  In particular, [[shale]]s usually emit more gamma rays than other sedimentary rocks, such as [[sandstone]], [[gypsum]], [[halite|salt]], [[coal]], [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]], or [[limestone]] because radioactive potassium is a common component in their clay content, and because the [[cation exchange capacity]] of clay causes them to adsorb [[uranium]] and [[thorium]].  This difference in radioactivity between shales and sandstones/carbonate rocks allows the gamma ray tool to distinguish between shales and non-shales. But it cannot distinguish between carbonates and sandstone as they both have similar deflections on the gamma ray log. Thus gamma ray logs cannot be said to make good lithological logs by themselves, but in practice, gamma ray logs are compared side-by-side with stratigraphic logs.  

The gamma ray log, like other types of [[well logging]], is done by lowering an instrument down the drill hole and recording gamma radiation variation with depth.  In the [[United States]], the device most commonly records measurements at 1/2-foot intervals.  Gamma radiation is usually recorded in [[American_Petroleum_Institute#Standards_and_certification|API unit]]s, a measurement originated by the petroleum industry.  Gamma rays attenuate according to the diameter of the borehole mainly because of the properties of the fluid filling the borehole, but because gamma logs are generally used in a qualitative way, amplitude corrections are usually not necessary. 

Three elements and their decay chains are responsible for the radiation emitted by rock: [[potassium]], [[thorium]] and [[uranium]].  Shales often contain potassium as part of their clay content and tend to adsorb uranium and thorium as well.  A common gamma-ray log records the total radiation and cannot distinguish between the radioactive elements, while a spectral gamma ray log (see below) can.

For standard gamma-ray logs, the measured value of gamma-ray radiation is calculated from concentration of uranium in ppm, thorium in ppm, and potassium in weight percent: e.g., GR API = 8 × uranium concentration in ppm + 4 × thorium concentration in ppm + 16 × potassium concentration in weight percent. Due to the weighted nature of uranium concentration in the GR API calculation, anomalous concentrations of uranium can cause clean sand reservoirs to appear shaley. For this reason, spectral gamma ray is used to provide an individual reading for each element so that anomalous concentrations can be found and properly interpreted.

An advantage of the gamma log over some other types of well logs is that it works through the steel and cement walls of cased boreholes.  Although concrete and steel absorb some of the gamma radiation, enough travels through the steel and cement to allow for qualitative determinations. 

In some places, non-shales exhibit elevated levels of gamma radiation.  For instance, sandstones can contain uranium minerals, potassium [[feldspar]], clay filling, or lithic fragments that cause the rock to have higher than usual gamma readings.  [[Coal]] and dolomite may contain adsorbed uranium.  [[Evaporites|Evaporite]] deposits may contain potassium minerals such as [[sylvite]] and [[carnallite]].  When this is the case, spectral gamma ray logging should be done to identify the source of these anomalies.

==Spectral logging==
Spectral logging is the technique of measuring the spectrum, or number and energy, of gamma rays emitted via natural radioactivity of the rock formation. There are three main sources of natural radioactivity on Earth: potassium (40K), thorium (principally 232Th and 230Th), and uranium (principally 238U and 235U). These radioactive isotopes each emit gamma rays that have a characteristic energy level measured in MeV. The quantity and energy of these gamma rays can be measured by a scintillometer. A log of the spectroscopic response to natural gamma ray radiation is usually presented as a total gamma ray log that plots the weight fraction of potassium (%), thorium (ppm) and uranium (ppm). The primary standards for the weight fractions are geological formations with known quantities of the three isotopes. Natural gamma ray spectroscopy logs became routinely used in the early 1970s, although they had been studied from the 1950s.

The characteristic gamma ray line that is associated with each radioactive component:

* Potassium : Gamma ray energy 1.46 [[MeV]]
* Thorium series: Gamma ray energy  2.61 MeV
* Uranium-Radium series: Gamma ray energy 1.76 MeV

Another example of the use of spectral gamma ray logs is to identify specific clay types, like [[kaolinite]] or [[illite]]. This may be useful for interpreting the environment of deposition as kaolinite can form from [[feldspars]] in tropical soils by leaching of potassium; and low potassium readings may thus indicate the presence of one or more [[paleosols]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epgeology.com/sequence-stratigraphy-f20/fluvial-sequence-stratigraphy-using-thorium-potassium-t461.html Fluvial Sequence Stratigraphy using Thorium &amp; Potassium] on [http://www.epgeology.com/ E&amp;P geology]&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of specific clay minerals is also useful for calculating the effective porosity of reservoir rock.

==Use in mineral exploration==
Gamma ray logs are also used in mineral exploration, especially exploration for phosphates, [[uranium]], and [[potassium]] salts.

'''Gas porosity''' is the fraction of a rock or sediment filled with a [[gas]].

Determining the true [[porosity]] of a gas filled formation has always been a problem in the oil industry. While [[natural gas]] is a [[hydrocarbon]], similar to oil, the physical properties of the fluids are very different, making it very hard to correctly quantify the total amount of gas in a formation. Well logging interpretation of the amount of hydrocarbon in the pore space of a formation, relies on the fluid being oil. Gas is light compared to oil causing density logging ([[gamma ray]] emitting sensors) based measurements to produce anomalous signals. Similarly, measurements that rely on detecting [[hydrogen]] ([[neutron]] emitting sensors) can miss detecting or correctly interpreting the presence of gas because of the lower hydrogen concentration in gas, compared to oil.

By properly combining the two erroneous answers from density and [[neutron]] logging, it is possible to arrive at a more accurate porosity than would be possible by interpreting each of the measurements separately.

== True porosity of a gas reservoir ==
A popular method of obtaining a formation porosity estimate is based on the simultaneous use of neutron and density logs. Under normal logging conditions, the porosity estimates obtained from these tools agree, when plotted on an appropriate [[lithology]] and fluid scale. However, in the case of a reservoir where there is gas instead of water or oil in the pore space, the two porosity logs separate, to form what is referred to as gas crossover. Under these conditions, the true formation porosity lies between the measured neutron and density values. Log interpreters often find it difficult to accurately estimate the true formation porosity from these two curves. 

Neutron and density logging tools have different responses to the presence of gas in the formation because of differences in the physics of the measurements. A neutron tool response is sensitive mainly to the number of hydrogen atoms in the formation. During the calibration process, water-filled formations are used to develop porosity [[algorithm]]s, and under these conditions, a lower number of hydrogen atoms is equivalent to a lower porosity. Consequently, when a gas-filled formation is logged, which has a lower number of hydrogen atoms than a water-filled formation of the same porosity, the porosity estimate will be lower than the true porosity. 

The density tool, on the other hand, measures the total number of formation electrons. Like the neutron tool, water-filled formations are used in its calibration process. Under these conditions, a lower number of electrons is equivalent to a lower formation density, or a higher formation porosity. Therefore, logging a gas-filled formation, results in a porosity estimate that is higher than the true porosity. Overlaying the neutron and density curves in a gas-bearing zone results in the classic crossover separation.

== Gas porosity in the presence of borehole fluid invasion into the reservoir ==
The process of estimating the true [[porosity]] in the gas region relies on the appropriate use of the two porosity logs. The process is further complicated by the effects of borehole fluid invasion. Invasion tends to force the gas from the formation and replace it with borehole fluid. The neutron tool begins to sense the presence of more hydrogen atoms and yields a porosity estimate that is higher than before when only the gas was present; the opposite occurs for the density tool. The increase in the amount of water in the near formation, i.e., the increase in the number of electrons, is interpreted by the density tool algorithm as a higher density which translates into a lower porosity estimate. The end result is that the separation between the two curves begins to disappear as the invasion front increases in radial depth. The rate at which the two porosity logs approach the true porosity depends upon their radial sensitivities and their respective depths of investigations (DOI). 

As the invasion fluid front gets deeper into the reservoir, the neutron and density porosity measurements approach the true porosity. For shallow invasion, i.e. shallow with respect to the depths of investigation (DOIs) of the two tools, the tools' responses are spatially weighted averages of the invaded and noninvaded regions of the formation. The result is a reduced crossover. For deep invasion (invasion beyond the DOIs of both tools) the crossover indication disappears and the two logs will not recognize the presence of gas. 

A main complication in deriving an accurate [[effective porosity|porosity]] in the presence of shallow invasion comes from the fact that the neutron and density logging devices typically have different DOIs. It is well known that the 50% DOI of the thermal neutron porosity tool is 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30&amp;nbsp;cm) depending upon the porosity and gas saturation of the formation and the 50% DOI of the density tool is about 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8&amp;nbsp;cm). When the invasion front is greater than 12 inches (30&amp;nbsp;cm), both tools see only water-filled formations and the two porosity estimates agree and read true porosity. When the invasion front is less than 12 inches (30&amp;nbsp;cm) but greater than 6 inches (15&amp;nbsp;cm), the density tool sees only the invaded formation while the neutron tool is sensitive to both the invaded and the noninvaded region. Under these conditions, the density porosity estimate is the true value, while the neutron porosity estimate is still low. Below 6 inches (15&amp;nbsp;cm) of invasion, both tools are sensitive to both the invaded and noninvaded regions. Thus, for a certain range of depths of invasion, accurate determination of formation porosity becomes very difficult. 

Without the knowledge of the depth of the invasion front, porosity determination in the intermediate invasion range becomes virtually impossible. However, cross plot techniques rely on combinations of the neutron and density data that can be tuned to a particular invasion front depth. For example, the commonly used [[Root mean square]] (RMS) equation for gas reservoirs: 

φ&lt;sub&gt;formation&lt;/sub&gt; = ((φ&lt;sub&gt;Density&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; +φ&lt;sub&gt;Neutron&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)/2 )&lt;sup&gt;0.5&lt;/sup&gt;               (1) 

gives accurate porosity estimates for every shallow invasion of approximately 1 inch (2.5&amp;nbsp;cm), but can be up to 5 p.u. too low for 4 inch (10&amp;nbsp;cm) invasions. The simple arithmetic average of the estimates, still used by many log analysts, introduces even larger errors. Multivariate techniques can in principle, model the density and neutron responses correctly for any invasion diameter. However, since this diameter is rarely known, the common practice is to assume no invasion. In such cases, porosity and gas volumes can be obtained correctly only for very shallow, or no invasion. 

Recent attempts at obtaining better porosity estimates under these conditions have been reported. These attempts show that the use of a neutron porosity device which has a DOI similar to that of the density device could simplify porosity evaluation in gas reservoirs. However, as previously stated, in a partially invaded gas information, there can be a large error in the determination of the true porosity using either the density or neutron measurement. Therefore, a means is needed for determining the true porosity at an unknown formation depth of invasion using the measured density and neutron porosities in a gas zone or partially saturated gas zone. 

The best estimation of the porosity of the gas reservoir, particularly in the presence of invasion, is obtained by linearly combining the density and neutron measurements, using a gas correction factor A.

φ&lt;sub&gt;formation&lt;/sub&gt; =A*φ&lt;sub&gt;density&lt;/sub&gt; +(1-A)*φ&lt;sub&gt;neutron&lt;/sub&gt;/A                   (2)

This method provides a much more accurate estimate of the true formation porosity, in the presence of gas, particularly in formations that are not invaded by fluids from the wellbore.

which is a multidisciplinary, interoperable and updatable knowledge base about the subsurface.

Geomodelling is commonly used for managing [[natural resources]], identifying [[natural hazards]], and quantifying [[geology|geological processes]], with main applications to [[Petroleum|oil]] and gas fields, groundwater [[aquifer]]s and [[ore]] deposits.  For example, in the [[oil and gas industry]], realistic geologic models are required as input to [[reservoir simulator]] programs, which predict the behavior of the rocks under various [[hydrocarbon]] recovery scenarios. A reservoir can only be developed and produced once; therefore, making a mistake by selecting a site with poor conditions for development is tragic and wasteful. Using geological models and [[reservoir simulation]] allows [[reservoir engineers]] to identify which recovery options offer the safest and most economic, efficient, and effective development plan for a particular reservoir.

Geologic modelling is a relatively recent subdiscipline of [[geology]] which integrates [[structural geology]], [[sedimentology]], [[stratigraphy]], [[paleoclimatology]], and [[diagenesis]];

In 2-dimensions (2D), a [[geologic formation]] or unit is represented by a polygon, which can be bounded by faults, unconformities or by its lateral extent, or crop. In geological models a geological unit is bounded by 3-dimensional (3D) triangulated or gridded surfaces. The equivalent to the mapped polygon is the fully enclosed geological unit, using a triangulated mesh. For the purpose of property or fluid modelling these volumes can be separated further into an array of cells, often referred to as [[voxel]]s (volumetric elements). These 3D grids are the equivalent to 2D grids used to express properties of single surfaces.

Geomodelling generally involves the following steps: 
# Preliminary analysis of geological context of the domain of study.
# Interpretation of available data and observations as point sets or polygonal lines (e.g. "fault sticks" corresponding to faults on a vertical seismic section).
# Construction of a structural model describing the main rock boundaries (horizons, unconformities, intrusions, faults)&lt;ref name="StructMod"&gt;Caumon, G., Collon-Drouaillet, P., Le Carlier de Veslud, C., Sausse, J. and Viseur, S. (2009), Surface-based 3D modeling of geological structures, ''Mathematical Geosciences'', 41(9):927–945&lt;/ref&gt;
# Definition of a three-dimensional mesh honoring the structural model to support volumetric representation of heterogeneity (see [[Geostatistics]]) and solving the [[Partial differential equation|Partial Differential Equations]] which govern physical processes in the subsurface (e.g. [[Seismology|seismic wave propagation]], fluid transport in porous media).

== Geologic modelling components ==

=== Structural framework ===
Incorporating the spatial positions of the major formation boundaries, including the effects of [[Fault (geology)|faulting]], [[Fold (geology)|folding]], and [[erosion]] ([[unconformity|unconformities]]).  The major stratigraphic divisions are further subdivided into layers of cells with differing geometries with relation to the bounding surfaces (parallel to top, parallel to base, proportional).  Maximum cell dimensions are dictated by the minimum sizes of the features to be resolved (everyday example:  On a digital map of a city, the location of a city park might be adequately resolved by one big green pixel, but to define the locations of the basketball court, the baseball field, and the pool, much smaller pixels – higher resolution – need to be used).

=== Rock type ===
Each cell in the model is assigned a rock type.  In a coastal [[clastic|clastic environment]], these might be beach sand, high water energy marine [[upper shoreface]] sand, intermediate water energy marine [[lower shoreface]] sand, and deeper low energy marine [[silt]] and [[shale]].  The distribution of these rock types within the model is controlled by several methods, including map boundary polygons, rock type probability maps, or statistically emplaced based on sufficiently closely spaced well data.

=== Reservoir quality ===
Reservoir quality parameters almost always include [[porosity]] and [[Permeability (fluid)|permeability]], but may include measures of clay content, cementation factors, and other factors that affect the storage and deliverability of fluids contained in the pores of those rocks. [[Geostatistics|Geostatistical]] techniques are most often used to populate the cells with porosity and permeability values that are appropriate for the rock type of each cell.

=== Fluid saturation ===
[[Image:MODFLOW 3D grid.png|thumb|right|A 3D [[finite difference]] grid used in [[MODFLOW]] for simulating groundwater flow in an aquifer.]]
Most rock is completely [[aquifer|saturated]] with [[groundwater]].  Sometimes, under the right conditions, some of the pore space in the rock is occupied by other liquids or gases.  In the energy industry, [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]] are the fluids most commonly being modelled.  The preferred methods for calculating hydrocarbon saturations in a geologic model incorporate an estimate of pore throat size, the [[density|densities]] of the fluids, and the height of the cell above the [[water contact]], since these factors exert the strongest influence on [[capillary action]], which ultimately controls fluid saturations.

=== Geostatistics ===
An important part of geologic modelling is related to [[geostatistics]]. In order to represent the observed data, often
not on regular grids, we have to use certain interpolation techniques. The most widely used technique is [[kriging]]
which uses the spatial correlation among data and intends to construct the interpolation via semi-variograms. To reproduce more realistic spatial variability and help assess spatial uncertainty between data, geostatistical simulation based on variograms, training images, or parametric geological objects is often used.

=== Mineral Deposits ===
Geologists involved in [[mining]] and [[mineral exploration]] use geologic modelling to determine the geometry and placement of [[mineral]] deposits in the subsurface of the earth.  Geologic models help define the volume and concentration of minerals, to which [[Economic geology|economic constraints]] are applied to determine the economic value of the [[Mineralization (geology)|mineralization]].  Mineral deposits that are deemed to be economic may be developed into a [[mining|mine]].

== Technology ==

Geomodelling and [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] share a lot of common technologies. Software is usually implemented using object-oriented programming technologies in [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] or [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] on one or multiple computer platforms. The graphical user interface generally consists of one or several 3D and 2D graphics windows to visualize spatial data, interpretations and modelling output. Such visualization is generally achieved by exploiting [[graphics hardware]]. User interaction is mostly performed through mouse and keyboard, although 3D pointing devices and [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment|immersive environments]] may be used in some specific cases. GIS (Geographic Information System) is also a widely used tool to manipulate geological data.

Geometric objects are represented with parametric curves and surfaces or discrete models such as [[polygon mesh|polygonal meshes]].&lt;ref name="StructMod" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mallet02"&gt;Mallet, J.-L., Geomodeling, Applied Geostatistics Series.

== History ==

In the 70's, geomodelling mainly consisted of automatic 2D cartographic techniques such as contouring, implemented as [[FORTRAN]] routines communicating directly with [[plotter|plotting hardware]]. The advent of workstations with [[3D graphics]] capabilities during the 80's gave birth to a new generation of geomodelling software with graphical user interface which became mature during the 90's.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dgi.com/dynamicgraphics/dgimain.html Dynamic Graphics History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725233528/http://www.dgi.com/dynamicgraphics/dgimain.html |date=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gocad.org/w4/index.php/gocad/origin Origin of the Gocad software]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

Since its inception, geomodelling has been mainly motivated and supported by oil and gas industry.

==Geologic modelling software==
Software developers have built several packages for geologic modelling purposes. Such software can display, edit, digitise and automatically calculate the parameters required by engineers, geologists and surveyors. Current software is mainly developed and commercialized by oil and gas or mining industry software vendors:

'''Geologic overpressure''' in [[stratigraphic]] layers is caused by the inability of [[connate fluids|connate pore fluids]] to escape as the surrounding mineral matrix compacts under the [[lithostatic pressure]] caused by overlying layers. Fluid escape may be impeded by sealing of the compacting rock by surrounding impermeable layers (such as [[evaporite]]s, [[chalk]] and cemented [[sandstone]]s). Alternatively, the rate of burial of the stratigraphic layer may be so great that the efflux of fluid is not sufficiently rapid to maintain [[Fluid statics|hydrostatic]] pressure.

Common situations where overpressure may occur: in a buried river channel filled with coarse sand that is sealed on all sides by impermeable shales, or when there is an explosion within a confined space.

It is extremely important to be able to diagnose overpressured units when drilling through them, as the [[drilling mud]] weight (density) must be adjusted to compensate. If it is not, there is a risk that the pressure difference down-well will cause a dramatic decompression of the overpressured layer and result in a [[blowout (well drilling)|blowout]] at the well-head with possibly disastrous consequences.
 	
Because overpressured sediments tend to exhibit better [[porosity]] than would be predicted from their depth, they often make attractive [[hydrocarbon]] reservoirs and are therefore of important economic interest.

The '''Glaciogenic Reservoir Analogue Studies Project''' ('''GRASP''') is a research group studying the subglacial to proglacial record of [[Pleistocene]] glacial events. It is based in the [[Delft University of Technology]].

==Introduction to glaciogenic reservoirs==

Glaciogenic reservoirs are sedimentary rocks deposited under an ice sheet influence and that are involved into a gas or [[oil reservoir]]. The glacial earth system is complex to study. A large amount on past and ongoing scientific programs work(ed) on our [[cryosphere]] and generate a lot of debate about its dynamic, sustainability and behavior against [[climate change]]s. Past glaciations or ice ages  record occurred several times ([[Timeline of glaciation]]) along the [[geological time scale]]. As they are hundreds of million years old, these ancient glaciations are even more hard to analyse and study. Earth at that time had a different atmosphere composition, the chemistry of the oceans was also different, life evolution on earth had also a great impact on the dynamic of these ice sheets, the continents were in a particular setting, etc. Geologists have a broad idea of all those parameters but glaciologists know that this is the combination of those setting that bring to our current ice-age.
A glacial system is able to produce a very large amount of sediment due to the tremendous erosive forces of ice at its base. Those sediments are particularly coarse-grained (principally sandstones and conglomerates) and produced in consequent volumes [http://www.bgr.de/ecord/index.html?/ecord/basins/basins_focus.htm]. For their good reservoir properties, ancient glacially-related sediments have been targeted by oil industries. They are currently massively exploited in North Africa, in the Arabic peninsula, South Africa, and few small fields are present in Asia, Australia and Northern Europe. The main ice ages concerned are the Late Ordovician glaciation ([[Hirnantian]]) and the [[Permo-Carboniferous]] glaciations.

==Project objectives==

[[Analogy]] is a usual geologist method, using the present day observations and project/adapt it to the ancient earth systems. The main problem of this technique is the time-scale considered and the observation methods used. Most of the time, observations of active ice-sheet processes are instantaneous at geological time-scale and hard to apply in the ancient. Furthermore, in the ancient, field and geophysical studies are carried out at lower resolution but on a wider scale (time and space). Finally, even if [[Subglacial lake]]s are observed below ice sheets, melt-water drainage system processes ongoing, especially like the [[tunnel valley]]s remain unobserved directly.&lt;ref&gt;Siegert, M.J., Le Brocq, A. And Payne A. Hydrological connections between Antarctic subglacial lakes and the flow of water beneath the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. In, Glacial Sedimentary Processes and Products (Hambrey, M.J., Christoffersen, P., Glasser, N.F. and Hubbard, B.P). Special Publication #39, International Association of Sedimentologists, 3-10. (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The record of these huge subglacial "rivers" is mainly analysed via the recent ice ages imprints ([[Weichselian]], [[Saalian]] and [[Pre-Illinoian]] or [[Anglian Stage|Elsterian]] stages)&lt;ref&gt;M. Huuse,and H. Lykke-Andersen (2000).Overdeepened Quaternary valleys in the eastern Danish North Sea: morphology and origin.Quaternary Science Reviews 19. p. 1233-1253&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Praeg (2003). Seismic imaging of mid-Pleistocene tunnel-valleys in the North Sea Basin—high resolution from low frequencies. Journal of Applied Geophysics 53. 273– 298&lt;/ref&gt; and in the ancient one ([[Late Ordovician]]&lt;ref&gt;Ghienne, J.F., &amp; Deynoux, M. 1998. Large-scale channel fill structures in Late Ordovician
glacial deposits in Mauritania, western Sahara. Sedimentary Geology 119. p.141-159&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Permo-Carboniferous]]&lt;ref&gt;J. N. J. Visser (1988). A Permo-Carboniferous tunnel valley system east of Barkly West, northern Cape Province. South African Journal of Geology; September 1988; v. 91; no. 3. p. 350-357.&lt;/ref&gt;)
	
The idea of GRASP is to use methods commonly applied in the ancient onto recent glaciation record ([[Pleistocene]]). In the ancient, wide datasets are acquired by oil companies during exploration of [[sedimentary basin]]s. By using the same type of data for the [[Pleistocene]] glacial record, the project tries to generate data comparable in between ancient and recent glaciations. The studied area is the [[North Sea]] that was glaciated during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] as well as the Northwestern Europe. On the sea floor, around the North Sea and into the kilometre of sediments below, many traces and evidences of the glacial events are recorded. As this place is a petroleum province, many data, especially geophysics ones are currently released or could be borrowed for academic purposes.	
	
So, by joining the skills of three different universities, with the help of many data providers and the funding of six oil companies, new income is made into the knowledge of paleo-glacial systems. Basin analysis containing geophysical, reservoir and sedimentological models are produced in a new way and in a new type of environment. In an economic point of view, oil companies are interested in these models to have comparable data with their oil fields. In an academic one, understanding the recent ice sheet dynamic and is associated subglacial meltwater flow is crucial in the context of [[climate change]]s or fundamentally solving the intricate glacial record equation of recent and past ice ages.

[[File:Erdöl Bohrturm.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[List of components of oil drilling rigs|Onshore Drilling Rig]]]]

'''Hydrocarbon exploration''' (or '''oil and gas exploration''') is the search by [[petroleum geologist]]s and [[geophysicists]] for deposits of [[hydrocarbon]]s, particularly [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]], in the [[Earth#Crust|Earth]] using [[petroleum geology]].

== Exploration methods ==

Visible surface features such as [[oil seep]]s, natural gas seeps, [[Pockmark (geology)|pockmark]]s (underwater craters caused by escaping gas) provide basic evidence of hydrocarbon generation (be it shallow or deep in the Earth). However, most exploration depends on highly sophisticated technology to detect and determine the extent of these deposits using [[exploration geophysics]]. Areas thought to contain hydrocarbons are initially subjected to a [[gravimeter|gravity survey]], [[magnetometer|magnetic survey]], [[passive seismic]] or regional [[Reflection seismology|seismic reflection surveys]] to detect large-scale features of the sub-surface geology. Features of interest (known as ''leads'') are subjected to more detailed seismic surveys which work on the principle of the time it takes for reflected sound waves to travel through matter (rock) of varying densities and using the process of [[depth conversion]] to create a profile of the substructure. Finally, when a prospect has been identified and evaluated and passes the oil company's selection criteria, an [[oil well|exploration well]] is drilled in an attempt to conclusively determine the presence or absence of oil or gas.Offshore the risk can be reduced by using electromagnetic methods &lt;ref&gt;Stéphane Sainson, ''Electromagnetic seabed logging, A new tool for geoscientists''. Ed. Springer, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Oil exploration is an expensive, high-risk operation. Offshore and remote area exploration is generally only undertaken by very large corporations or national governments. Typical shallow shelf oil wells (e.g. [[North Sea]]) cost US$10 – 30 million, while deep water wells can cost up to US$100 million plus. Hundreds of smaller companies search for onshore hydrocarbon deposits worldwide, with some wells costing as little as US$100,000.

== Elements of a petroleum prospect ==
[[File:Mudlogging.JPG|thumb|[[Mud log]] in process, a common way to study the rock types when drilling oil wells.]]

A prospect is a potential [[Structural trap|trap]] which geologists believe may contain hydrocarbons. A significant amount of geological, structural and seismic investigation must first be completed to redefine the potential hydrocarbon drill location from a [[Lead (geology)|lead]] to a prospect. Four geological factors have to be present for a prospect to work and if any of them fail neither oil nor gas will be present.

; [[Source rock]] : When organic-rich rock such as [[oil shale]] or coal is subjected to [[catagenesis (geology)|high pressure and temperature]] over an extended period of time, hydrocarbons form.
; Migration : The hydrocarbons are expelled from source rock by three [[density|density-related]] mechanisms: the newly matured hydrocarbons are less dense than their precursors, which causes over-pressure; the hydrocarbons are lighter, and so migrate upwards due to buoyancy, and the fluids expand as further burial causes increased heating. Most hydrocarbons migrate to the surface as oil [[seep]]s, but some will get trapped.
; [[Petroleum reservoir|Reservoir]] : The hydrocarbons are contained in a reservoir rock. This is commonly a porous [[sandstone]] or [[limestone]]. The oil collects in the pores within the rock although open fractures within non-porous rocks (e.g. fractured [[granite]]) may also store hydrocarbons. The reservoir must also be permeable so that the hydrocarbons will flow to surface during production.
; Trap : The hydrocarbons are buoyant and have to be trapped within a structural (e.g. [[Anticline]], [[fault block]]) or [[stratigraphic trap]]. The hydrocarbon trap has to be covered by an impermeable rock known as a seal or [[caprock|cap-rock]] in order to prevent hydrocarbons escaping to the surface

== Exploration risk ==

Hydrocarbon exploration is a high risk investment and risk assessment is paramount for successful [[project portfolio management]]. Exploration risk is a difficult concept and is usually defined by assigning confidence to the presence of the imperative geological factors, as discussed above. This confidence is based on data and/or models and is usually mapped on Common Risk Segment Maps (CRS Maps). High confidence in the presence of imperative geological factors is usually coloured green and low confidence coloured red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epgeology.com/general-discussion-f28/assigning-exploration-risks-t157.html|title=Assigning exploration risks : Risk and Play Mapping - Exploration &amp; Production Geology|author=|date=|website=www.epgeology.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710194434/http://www.epgeology.com/general-discussion-f28/assigning-exploration-risks-t157.html|archivedate=2011-07-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, these maps are also called Traffic Light Maps, while the full procedure is often referred to as Play Fairway Analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccop.or.th/projects/PPM/Case_Study_Phillipines_files/Second+workshop/presentations%5CP12+PhilPRA+Play+Analysis+presentation+2nd+workshop.pdf|title=Coordinating Committee for Geoscience Programmes in East and Southeast Asia|author=|date=|website=www.ccop.or.th|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312084032/http://ccop.or.th/projects/ppm/case_study_phillipines_files/second%20workshop/presentations/p12%20philpra%20play%20analysis%20presentation%202nd%20workshop.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of such procedures is to force the geologist to objectively assess all different geological factors. Furthermore, it results in simple maps that can be understood by non-geologists and managers to base exploration decisions on.

; Prospect : A lead which has been more fully evaluated.
; Recoverable hydrocarbons : Amount of hydrocarbon likely to be recovered during production. This is typically 10-50% in an oil field and 50-80% in a gas field.

== Licensing ==

Petroleum resources are typically owned by the government of the host country. In the United States, most onshore (land) oil and gas rights (OGM) are owned by private individuals, in which case oil companies must negotiate terms for a lease of these rights with the individual who owns the OGM. Sometimes this is not the same person who owns the land surface. In most nations the government issues licences to explore, develop and produce its oil and gas resources, which are typically administered by the oil ministry. There are several different types of licence. Oil companies often operate in joint ventures to spread the risk; one of the companies in the partnership is designated the operator who actually supervises the work.

; [[Tax]] and [[Royalties|Royalty]] : Companies would pay a royalty on any oil produced, together with a profits tax (which can have expenditure offset against it). In some cases there are also various bonuses and ground rents (license fees) payable to the government - for example a signature bonus payable at the start of the licence. Licences are awarded in competitive bid rounds on the basis of either the size of the work programme (number of wells, seismic etc.) or size of the signature bonus.
; Production Sharing contract (PSA) : A PSA is more complex than a Tax/Royalty system - The companies bid on the percentage of the production that the host government receives (this may be variable with the oil price), There is often also participation by the Government owned National Oil Company (NOC). There are also various bonuses to be paid. Development expenditure is offset against production revenue.
; Service contract : This is when an oil company acts as a contractor for the host government, being paid to produce the hydrocarbons.

== Reserves and resources ==

Resources are hydrocarbons which may or may not be produced in the future. A resource number may be assigned to an undrilled prospect or an unappraised discovery. Appraisal by drilling additional delineation wells or acquiring extra seismic data will confirm the size of the field and lead to project sanction. At this point the relevant government body gives the oil company a production licence which enables the field to be developed. This is also the point at which [[oil reserves]] and [[gas reserves]] can be formally booked.

===Oil and gas reserves===
Oil and gas reserves are defined as volumes that will be commercially recovered in the future. Reserves are separated into three categories: proved, probable, and possible. To be included in any reserves category, all commercial aspects must have been addressed, which includes government consent. Technical issues alone separate proved from unproved categories. All reserve estimates involve some degree of uncertainty.

*'''Proved reserves''' are the highest valued category. [[Proved reserves]] have a "reasonable certainty" of being recovered, which means a high degree of confidence that the volumes will be recovered. Some industry specialists refer to this as P90, i.e., having a 90% certainty of being produced. The SEC provides a more detailed definition:
Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2008/33-8995.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830040859/https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2008/33-8995.pdf |archivedate=2017-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Probable reserves''' are volumes defined as "less likely to be recovered than proved, but more certain to be recovered than Possible Reserves". Some industry specialists refer to this as P50, i.e., having a 50% certainty of being produced.
* '''Possible reserves''' are reserves which analysis of geological and engineering data suggests are less likely to be recoverable than probable reserves. Some industry specialists refer to this as P10, i.e., having a 10% certainty of being produced.

The term 1P is frequently used to denote proved reserves; 2P is the sum of proved and probable reserves; and 3P the sum of proved, probable, and possible reserves. The best estimate of recovery from committed projects is generally considered to be the 2P sum of proved and probable reserves. Note that these volumes only refer to currently justified projects or those projects already in development.&lt;ref&gt;"SPE Petroleum Resources Management System

===Reserve booking===
Oil and gas reserves are the main asset of an oil company. Booking is the process by which they are added to the balance sheet.

In the United States, booking is done according to a set of rules developed by the [[Society of Petroleum Engineers]] (SPE). The reserves of any company listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] have to be stated to the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]. Reported reserves may be audited by outside geologists, although this is not a legal requirement.

In Russia, companies report their reserves to the State Commission on Mineral Reserves (GKZ).{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In [[petroleum geology]], the '''maturity''' of a [[Rock (geology)|rock]] is a measure of its state in terms of [[hydrocarbon]] generation. Maturity is established using a combination of [[geochemistry|geochemical]] and [[basin modelling]] techniques.

Rocks with high [[total organic carbon]], (termed [[source rock]]s), will alter under increasing [[temperature]] such that the organic [[molecule]]s slowly mature into [[hydrocarbon]]s (see [[diagenesis]]). Source rocks are therefore broadly categorised as ''immature'' (no hydrocarbon generation), ''sub-mature'' (limited hydrocarbon generation), ''mature'' (extensive hydrocarbon generation) and ''overmature'' (most hydrocarbons have been generated).

The maturity of a source rock can also be used as an indicator of its hydrocarbon ''potential''. That is, if a rock is sub-mature, then it has a much higher potential to generate further hydrocarbons than one that is overmature.

{{Well logging}}
'''Mud logging''' is the creation of a detailed record ([[well logging|well log]]) of a borehole by examining the cuttings of rock brought to the surface by the circulating drilling medium (most commonly [[Drilling fluid|drilling mud]]). Mud logging is usually performed by a third-party [[drilling fluid|mud]] logging company. This provides well owners and producers with information about the [[lithology]] and fluid content of the borehole while drilling. Historically it is the earliest type of well log. Under some circumstances compressed air is employed as a circulating fluid, rather than mud. Although most commonly used in petroleum exploration, mud logging is also sometimes used when drilling water wells and in other mineral exploration, where drilling fluid is the circulating medium used to lift cuttings out of the hole.  In [[hydrocarbon exploration]], [[hydrocarbon]] surface gas detectors record the level of natural gas brought up in the mud. A mobile laboratory is situated by the mud logging company near the drilling rig or on deck of an offshore drilling rig, or on a drill ship.

==The service provided==
Mud logging technicians in an oil field drilling operation determine positions of hydrocarbons with respect to depth, identify downhole [[lithology]], monitor natural gas entering the drilling mud stream, and draw well logs for use by oil company [[geologist]]. Rock cuttings circulated to the surface in drilling mud are sampled and discussed.

The mud logging company is normally contracted by the oil company (or operator). They then organize this information in the form of a graphic log, showing the data charted on a representation of the wellbore.[1]
[[file:mudlogging.JPG|thumb|Well-site geologist mudlogging]]
The oil company representative (Company Man or "CoMan") together with the [[tool pusher]], and well-site geologist (WSG) provides mud loggers their instruction. The mud logging company is contracted specifically as to when to start well-logging activity and what services to provide. Mud logging may begin on the first day of drilling, known as the "spud in" date but is more likely at some later time (and depth) determined by the oil industry geologist's research. The mud logger may also possess logs from wells drilled in the surrounding area. This information (known as "offset data") can provide valuable clues as to the characteristics of the particular geo-strata that the rig crew is about to drill through.

Mud loggers connect various sensors to the drilling apparatus and install specialized equipment to monitor or "log" drill activity. This can be physically and mentally challenging, especially when having to be done during drilling activity. Much of the equipment will require precise calibration or alignment by the mud logger to provide accurate readings.

Mud logging technicians observe and interpret the indicators in the mud returns during the drilling process, and at regular intervals log properties such as drilling rate, mud weight, flowline temperature, oil indicators, pump pressure, pump rate, lithology (rock type) of the drilled cuttings, and other data. Mud logging requires a good deal of diligence and attention. Sampling the drilled cuttings must be performed at predetermined intervals, and can be difficult during rapid drilling.

Another important task of the mud logger is to monitor gas levels (and types) and notify other personnel on the rig when gas levels may be reaching dangerous levels, so appropriate steps can be taken to avoid a dangerous well blowout condition.
Because of the lag time between drilling and the time required for the mud and cuttings to return to the surface, a modern augmentation has come into use: Measurement while drilling.  The MWD technician, often a separate service company employee, logs data in a similar manner but the data is different in source and content. Most of the data logged by an MWD technician comes from expensive and complex, sometimes electronic, tools that are downhole installed at or near the drill bit.

==Scope==
[[File:Mud Log.jpg|thumb|250px|right|1" (5 foot average) mud log showing heavy ([[hydrocarbons]])  (large area of yellow)]]
Mud logging includes observation and microscopic examination of [[drill cuttings]] (formation rock chips), and evaluation of gas [[hydrocarbon]] and its constituents, basic chemical and mechanical parameters of [[drilling fluid]] or [[drilling mud]] (such as [[chloride]]s and temperature), as well as compiling other information about the drilling parameters. Then data is plotted on a graphic log called a [[mud log]].  [http://www.geomore.com/Mud%20Log.htm Example1], [https://web.archive.org/web/20060915063420/http://www.wellsight.com/images/logs/well-ft-log.jpg Example2].

Other real-time drilling parameters that may be compiled include, but are not limited to; rate of penetration ([[Rate of penetration|ROP]]) of the bit (sometimes called the drill rate), pump rate (quantity of fluid being pumped), pump pressure, weight on bit, [[drill string]] weight, rotary speed, rotary torque, RPM (Revolutions Per Minute), SPM (Strokes Per Minute) mud volumes, [[mud weight]] and mud [[viscosity]]. This information is usually obtained by attaching ''monitoring devices'' to the [[drilling rig|drilling rig's]] equipment with a few exceptions such as the mud weight and mud viscosity which are measured by the [[Derrick hand|derrickhand]] or the [[mud engineer]].

Rate of drilling is affected by the pressure of the column of mud in the borehole and its relative counterbalance to the internal pore pressures of the encountered rock. A rock pressure greater than the mud fluid will tend to cause rock fragments to spall as it is cut and can increase the drilling rate. "D-exponents" are mathematical trend lines which estimate this internal pressure. Thus both visual evidence of spalling and mathematical plotting assist in formulating recommendations for optimum drilling mud densities for both safety (blowout prevention) and economics. (Faster drilling is generally preferred.)

[[File:Mud Log cDExp1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|1" (every foot) mud log showing corrected d-Exponent trending into pressure above the sand]]
Mud logging is often written as a single word "mudlogging".  The finished product can be called a "mud log" or "mudlog".  The occupational description is "mud logger" or "mudlogger".  In most cases, the two word usage seems to be more common. The mud log provides a reliable ''time log'' of drilled formations.&lt;ref&gt;P.W. Purcell "Chapter 16 Mud Logging" pp. 347-354 in L.W. Leroy, D.O. Leroy, and J.W. Raese, editors, 1977, Subsurface Geology, Colorado School of Mines, Golden, 941 pp. {{ISBN|0-918062-00-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Details of the mud log ==

*The ''[[rate of penetration]]'' in (Figure 1 &amp; 2) is represented by the black line on the left side of the log. The farther to the left that the line goes, the faster the rate of penetration. On this mud log, ROP is measured in feet per hour but on some older, hand drawn [http://www.geomore.com/Mud%20Log.htm mud logs], it is measured in minutes per foot.
*The ''[[porosity]]'' in (Figure 1) is represented by the blue line farthest to the left of the log. It indicates the pore space within the rock structure. An analogy would be the holes in a sponge. The oil and gas resides within this pore space. Notice how far to the left the porosity goes where all the sand (in yellow) is. This indicates that the sand has good porosity. Porosity is not a direct or physical measurement of the pore space but rather an extrapolation from other drilling parameters and therefore not always reliable.
[[File:Drill cuttings - Annotated - 2004.jpg|thumb|250px|right|(Figure 3)&lt;br /&gt;Sample of [[drill cuttings]] of shale while drilling an [[oil well]] in [[Louisiana]]. For reference, the sand grain and red shale are approximately 2 mm. in dia.]]
*The ''[[lithology]]'' in (Figure 1 &amp; 2) is represented by the cyan, gray/black and yellow blocks of color. Cyan = [[lime (material)|lime]], gray/black = [[shale]] and yellow = [[sand]]. More yellow represents more sand identified at that depth. The lithology is measured as percentage of the total sample, as visually inspected under a microscope, normally at 10x magnification (Figure 3). These are but a fraction of the different types of [[Formation (stratigraphy)|formation]]s that might be encountered. (Color coding is not necessarily standardized among different mud logging companies, though the symbol representation for each are very similar.) In (Figure 3) you can see a sample of cuttings under a microscope at 10x magnification after they have been washed off. Some of the larger shale and lime fragments are separated from this sample by running it through [[sieves]] and must be considered when estimating percentages. Also, this image view is only a fragment of the total sample and some of the sand at the bottom of the tray can not be seen and must also be considered in the total estimation. With that in mind this sample would be considered to be about 90% shale, 5% sand and 5% lime (In 5% increments).
*The ''[[Natural gas|gas]]'' in (Figure 1 &amp; 2) is represented by the green line and is measured in [http://geospect.com/defining-a-unit-of-gas-in-mud-logging/ units] as the quantity of total gas, but does not represent the actual quantity of oil or gas the reservoir contains. In (Figure 1) the squared-off dash-dot lines just to the right of the sand (in yellow) and left of the gas (in green) represents the heavier hydrocarbons detected. Cyan = C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[ethane]]), purple = C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[propane]]) and blue = C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ([[butane]]). Detecting and analyzing these heavy gases help to determine the type of oil or gas the formation contains.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1282">In [[rock physics]] and [[petrophysics]], the '''mudrock line''', also called '''Castagna's equation''' or '''Castagna's relation''', is an [[Empirical research|empirical]] linear relation between [[seismology|seismic]] [[P-wave]] velocity and [[S-wave]] velocity in [[brine]]-saturated siliciclastic rocks (i.e. [[sandstone]]s and [[shale]]s).

The equation reads:

:&lt;math&gt;V_p = 1.16 V_s + 1.36&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;V_p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_s&lt;/math&gt; refer to P-wave velocity and S-wave velocity, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=J. P. |last1=Castagna |first2=M.

The name of the equation refers to [[John Castagna]], professor of [[exploration geophysics]] at the [[University of Houston]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geosc.uh.edu/people/faculty/john-castagna/index.php "University of Houston directory"&lt;/ref&gt; who discovered the relation while working for [[ARCO]], an oil company that is now a subsidiary of [[BP]].

{{Well logging}}
'''Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging''' is a type of [[well logging]] that uses the [[nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR response]] of a [[Formation (stratigraphy)|formation]] to directly determine its [[porosity]] and [[Permeability_(earth_sciences)|permeability]], providing a continuous record along the length of the [[borehole]].&lt;ref&gt;Gluyas, J. &amp; Swarbrick, R. (2004) Petroleum Geoscience. Publ. Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleinberg"&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging – Technology of the 21st century.  Kenyon, Kleinberg, Straley, Gubelin, and Morris. Oilfield Review. http://eps.mcgill.ca/~courses/c550/Literature/NMR-21st-century.pdf{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} &lt;/ref&gt;
==Background==
NMR logging exploits the large [[magnetic moment]] of [[hydrogen]], which is abundant in rocks in the form of [[pore water| water]].  The NMR signal amplitude is proportional to the quantity of hydrogen nuclei present in a formation and can be calibrated to give a value for porosity that is free from lithology effects.  Uniquely, a [[petrophysics|petrophysicist]] can also analyse the rate of decay of the NMR signal amplitude to obtain information on the permeability of the formation - a crucial quantity in [[hydrocarbon exploration]].

==Relationship of NMR signal to pore size==
The most important mechanism affecting NMR relaxation is grain-surface relaxation.&lt;ref name=Kleinberg /&gt;  Molecules in fluids are in constant [[Brownian motion]], diffusing about the pore space and bouncing off the grain surfaces.  Upon interaction with the grain surface, hydrogen protons can transfer some nuclear spin energy to the grain (contributing to [[T1 relaxation]]) or irreversibley dephase (contributing to [[T2 relaxation]]).  Therefore the speed of relaxation most significantly depends on how often the hydrogen nuclei collide with the grain surface and this is controlled by the surface-to-volume ratio of the pore in which the nuclei are located.  Collisions are less frequent in larger pores, resulting in a slower decay of the NMR signal amplitude and allowing a petrophysicist to understand the distribution of pore sizes.

&lt;/ref&gt; Oil shale formation takes place in a number of depositional settings and has considerable compositional variation. Oil shales can be classified by their composition ([[carbonate mineral]]s such as [[calcite]] or [[detrital]] minerals such as [[quartz]] and [[Clay minerals|clays]]) or by their [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional environment]] (large [[lake]]s, shallow marine, and [[lagoon]]/small lake settings). Much of the organic matter in oil shales is of [[algae|algal]] origin, but may also include remains of [[Vascular plant|vascular land plants]]. Three major type of organic matter ([[maceral]]s) in oil shale are [[telalginite]], [[lamalginite]], and [[bituminite]].&lt;ref name=hutton/&gt; Some oil shale deposits also contain metals which include [[vanadium]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], and [[uranium]].&lt;ref name=arvoots/&gt;&lt;ref name=dyni&gt;

Most oil shale deposits were formed during [[Middle Cambrian]], [[Ordovician|Early and Middle Ordovician]], [[Late Devonian]], [[Late Jurassic]], and [[Paleogene]] times through burial by sedimentary loading on top of the algal swamp deposits, resulting in conversion of the organic matter to kerogen by [[diagenesis|diagenetic]] processes.&lt;ref name=arvoots/&gt;&lt;ref name=es832/&gt;  The largest deposits are found in the remains of large lakes such as the deposits of the [[Green River Formation]] of Wyoming and Utah, USA. Oil-shale deposits formed in the shallow seas of continental shelves generally are much thinner than large lake basin deposits.&lt;ref name=sme/&gt;

There are varying classifications of oil shales depending on their mineral content, type of kerogen, age, depositional history, and organisms from which they are derived. The age of the known oil shale deposits ranges from [[Cambrian]] to [[Paleogene]] age. [[Lithology|Lithologies]] comprise shales and [[marl]] and [[carbonate rock]]s, all of which form a mixture of tightly bound organic matter and inorganic components.&lt;ref name=turkey/&gt;

Oil shales have been divided into three categories based on mineral composition – [[carbonate]]-rich shale, [[Silicon dioxide|siliceous]] shale and [[cannel coal|cannel shale]]. Carbonate-rich shales derive their name from the large amount of carbonate minerals such as [[calcite]] and [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]]. As many as twenty carbonate minerals have been found in oil shales, the majority of which are considered [[authigenic]] or [[Diagenesis|diagenetic]]. Carbonate-rich oil shales, particularly that of [[Lake|lacustrine]]-sourced deposits, have usually the organic-rich layers sandwiched between carbonate-rich layers. These deposits are hard formations that are resistant to weathering and they are difficult to process using ''ex-situ'' methods.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Siliceous oil shales are usually dark brown or black shales.&lt;ref name=elsevier/&gt; They are not rich in carbonates but rather in siliceous minerals such as [[quartz]], [[feldspar]], clay, [[chert]] and [[opal]]. Siliceous shales are not as hard and weather-resistant as carbonate-rich shales, and may be better suited for extraction via ''ex-situ'' methods.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;  Cannel shales are usually dark brown or black shales, which consist of organic matter that completely encloses other mineral grains. They are suitable for extraction via ''ex-situ'' methods.&lt;ref name=elsevier/&gt;

Another classification according to the type of kerogen, is based on the [[hydrogen]], [[carbon]], and [[oxygen]] content of the original organic matter in the oil shale. This classification is using the [[Van Krevelen diagram]].&lt;ref name=turkey/&gt;  The most used classification of oil shales was developed between 1987 and 1991 by Adrian C. Hutton of the [[University of Wollongong]], adapting [[Petrography|petrographic]] terms from coal terminology. According to this classification, oil shales are designated as [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]], [[Lake|lacustrine]] (lake-bottom-deposited), or [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] (ocean bottom-deposited), based on the environment where the initial [[biomass]] was deposited.&lt;ref name=hutton&gt;

[[Cannel coal]] (also called ''candle coal'') is a type of terrestrial shale, which is hydrogen-rich brown to black coal, sometimes with shaly texture, composed of resins, spores, [[wax]]es, [[cutin]]aceous and corky materials derived from [[Terrestrial plant|terrestrial]] vascular plants as well as varied amounts of [[vitrinite]] and [[inertinite]]. Lacustrine shales consist of [[lamosite]] and [[torbanite]]. Lamosite is a pale-brown and grayish-brown to dark-gray to black oil shale whose chief organic constituent is lamalginite derived from [[Plankton|lacustrine planktonic]] algae. Torbanite, named after Torbane Hill in Scotland, is a black oil shale whose organic matter is telalginite derived from lipid-rich ''[[Botryococcus]]'' and related algal forms. Marine shales consist of three varieties, namely [[kukersite]], [[tasmanite]], and [[marinite]]. Kukersite, named after Kukruse in Estonia, is a light-brown marine oil shale whose principal organic component is telalginite derived from the green alga, ''[[Gloeocapsomorpha prisca]]''. Tasmanite, named after [[Tasmania]], is a brown to black oil shale whose organic matter consists of telalginite derived chiefly from unicellular tasmanitid algae of marine origin. Marinite is a gray to dark-gray to black oil shale of marine origin in which the chief organic components are lamalginite and bituminite derived from marine [[phytoplankton]] with varied admixtures of [[bitumen]], telalginite, and vitrinite.&lt;ref name=dyni/&gt;

As a sapropel fuel, oil shale differs from [[humus]] fuels in its lower content of organic matter. The organic matter has an atomic ratio of hydrogen to carbon of about 1.5 – approximately the same as that of [[crude oil]] and four to five times higher than [[coal]]s. The organic matter in oil shales forms a complex macromolecular structure which is insoluble in common organic solvents.&lt;ref name=arvoots/&gt;&lt;ref name=wec&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  It is mixed with varied amounts of mineral matter. For commercial grades of oil shale, the ratio of organic matter to mineral matter is about 0.75:5 to 1.5:5.&lt;ref name=wec/&gt;

The organic portion of oil shale consists largely of a pre-bitumen bituminous groundmass, such as remains of algae, [[spore]]s, [[pollen]], [[plant cuticle]]s and corky fragments of [[herbaceous]] and woody plants, and cellular debris from other lacustrine, marine, and land plants.&lt;ref name=wec/&gt;&lt;ref name=alali&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  While terrestrial oil shales contain resins, spores, waxy cuticles, and corky tissues of roots and stems of vascular terrestrial plants, lacustrine oil shales include [[lipid]]-rich organic matter derived from algae. Marine oil shales are composed of marine algae, [[acritarch]]s, and marine [[dinoflagellate]]s.&lt;ref name=wec/&gt; Organic matter in oil shale also contains organic [[sulfur]] (about 1.8% on average) and a lower proportion of [[nitrogen]].&lt;ref name=arvoots/&gt;   

Three major types of organic matter ([[maceral]]s) in oil shale are telalginite, lamalginite, and bituminite. Telalginite is defined as structured organic matter composed of large colonial or thick-walled unicellular algae such as ''Botryococcus'' and ''Tasmanites''. Lamalginite includes thin-walled colonial or unicellular algae that occur as distinct laminae, but display few or no recognizable biologic structures. Under the microscope, telalginite and lamalginite are easily recognized by their bright shades of yellow under ultraviolet/blue fluorescent light. Bituminite is largely amorphous, lacks recognizable biologic structures, and displays relatively low [[fluorescence]] under the microscope. Other organic constituents include [[vitrinite]] and [[inertinite]], which are macerals derived from the [[humus|humic matter]] of land plants. These macerals are usually found in relatively small amounts in most oil shales.&lt;ref name=hutton/&gt;  

Mineral matter in oil shale contains fine-grained [[silicate]] and [[carbonate minerals]] such as [[calcite]], [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]], [[siderite]], [[quartz]], [[rutile]], [[orthoclase]], [[albite]], [[anorthite]], [[muscovite]], [[amphipole]], [[marcasite]], [[limonite]], [[gypsum]], [[nahcolite]], [[dawsonite]] and [[alum]].

== Formation ==
Most oil shale deposits were formed during [[Middle Cambrian]], [[Ordovician|Early and Middle Ordovician]], [[Late Devonian]], [[Late Jurassic]] and [[Paleogene]] times.&lt;ref name=arvoots/&gt; These were formed by the deposition of organic matter in a variety of [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional environments]] including freshwater to highly [[Salt lake|saline lakes]], [[Epeiric sea|epicontinental marine basins]] and [[Sublittoral zone|subtidal shelves]] and were restricted to [[Estuary|estuarine areas]] such as [[oxbow lake]]s, [[peat bogs]], [[limnic]] and coastal [[swamp]]s, and [[muskeg]]s.&lt;ref name=dyni/&gt; When plants die in such an anaerobic aquatic environment, low oxygen levels prevent their complete [[bacterial decay]].&lt;ref name=es832&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  

For undecayed organic matter to be preserved and to form oil shale, the environment must remain uniform for prolonged periods of time in order to build up sufficiently thick sequences of algal matter. Eventually, the algal swamp or other restricted environment is disrupted and oil shale accumulation ceases. Burial by sedimentary loading on top of the algal swamp deposits converts the organic matter to kerogen by the following normal diagenetic processes:
* Compaction due to sediment loading on the coal, leading to compression of the organic matter.
* With ongoing heat and compaction, removal of moisture in the [[peat]] and from the [[intracellular]] structure of fossilized plants, and removal of molecular water.
* [[Methanogenesis]]—similar to treating wood in a pressure cooker— results in methane being produced, removing hydrogen, some carbon, and some further oxygen.&lt;!--copyed's note: pls explain "further oxygen (as water)" — It is very hard for me to explain as this part of the article comes from the very first versions of the parent article and I am not really very familiar with this issue. Probably we could remove "(as water)", which is the most confusing here.--&gt;
* [[Dehydration]], which removes [[hydroxyl]] groups from the [[cellulose]] and other plant molecules, resulting in the production of hydrogen-[[redox|reduced]] coals or oil shales.&lt;ref name=es832/&gt;

Though similar in their formation process, oil shales differ from coals in several distinct ways. The precursors of the organic matter in oil shale and coal differ in a sense that oil shale is of algal origin, but may also include remains of vascular land plants that more commonly compose much of the organic matter in coal. The origin of some of the organic matter in oil shale is obscure because of the lack of recognizable biologic structures that would help identify the precursor organisms. Such materials may be of bacterial origin or the product of bacterial degradation of algae or other organic matter.&lt;ref name=dyni/&gt;

Lower temperature and pressure during the [[Diagenesis|diagenesis process]] compared to other modes of [[hydrocarbon]] generation result in a lower [[maturity (geology)|maturation]] level of oil shale. Continuous burial and further heating and increased pressure over time could result in the conventional production of oil and gas from the oil shale [[source rock]].&lt;ref name=gsw&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The largest deposits are found in the remains of large lakes such as the deposits of the [[Green River Formation]] of Wyoming and Utah, USA. Large lake oil shale basins are typically found in areas of [[block fault]]ing or crustal warping due to [[orogeny|mountain building]]. Deposits such as the Green River may be as much as {{convert|2000|ft|m|-1}} and yield up to 40&amp;nbsp;gallons of oil for each ton (166&amp;nbsp;l/t) of shale.&lt;ref name=elsevier/&gt;

Oil shale deposits formed in the shallow seas of continental shelves generally are much thinner than large lake basin deposits. These are typically a few meters thick and are spread over very large areas, extending up to thousands of square kilometers. Of the three lithologic types of oil shales, siliceous oil shales are most commonly found in such environments. These oil shales are not as organically rich as lake-deposited oil shales, and generally do not contain more than 30&amp;nbsp;gallons of extractable oil per ton of oil shale. Oil shales deposited in lagoonal or small lake environments are rarely extensive and are often associated with coal-bearing rocks.&lt;ref name=sme&gt;

=== Formations in the United States ===
The United States has two significant oil shale deposits which are suited for commercial development due to their size, grade and location. The [[Eocene]] [[Green River Formation]] covers parts of [[Colorado]], [[Wyoming]] and [[Utah]]; the second significant deposit is [[Devonian]] oil shales in the eastern United States. In both places, there are sub-basins varying in volume and quality of the reserves. Oil shale in the Green River Formation is found in five sedimentary basins namely, Green River, Uinta, Piceance Creek, Sand Wash and Washakie. The first three have undergone some significant exploration and attempts to commercialize the oil shale reserves since the 1960s. The Green River Formation includes deposits from two large lakes which covered an estimated area of over {{convert|65000|km2|sqmi|-1}} during the Early to Middle [[Eocene]]. These lakes were separated by the [[Uinta Mountains|Uinta]] uplift and the Axial Basin [[anticline]]. For significant periods during their 10&amp;nbsp;[[megaannum|Ma]] life, the lakes became closed systems allowing many changes in size, salinity and sedimentation. The deposition of oil shales resulted from abundant blue-green algae that thrived in the lakes.&lt;ref name=dyni/&gt;

The oil shale that underlies almost {{convert|750000|km2|sqmi|-1}} in the eastern United States was formed in a marine depositional environment, very different from the Green River Basins. These deposits{{specify|date=August 2018}} have also undergone commercialization attempts; they are also resources for [[natural gas]] and have been mined for low-grade oil shale. These oil shales were formed during the Late [[Devonian]] and Early [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]] [[period (geology)|periods]]. During this time, much of the eastern United States was covered by a large shallow sea. The oil shale is thought to have been the result of slow deposition of [[plankton]]ic algae.&lt;!--copyed's note: pls explain "quiet conditions" — Think this is not necessary to be added--&gt; under anoxic conditions. In parts of the basin close to the shoreline, the organic mixture that helped form the oil shale contains organic-rich sediment from the rising [[Appalachian mountains]].&lt;ref name=dyni/&gt;

=== Formations in Brazil ===
Brazil has nine significant locations of oil shale deposits. The size, location and quality of oil shale deposits in the [[Vale do Paraíba|Paraíba Valley]] and the [[Irati Formation]] have attracted the most attention. These two contain an estimated 1.4&amp;nbsp;billion barrels of ''in-situ'' [[shale oil]] with total resources as much as more than three billion barrels. While the "Irati formation" deposit is the smaller of the two, containing an estimated 600&amp;nbsp;million barrels ''in-situ'' compared to 840&amp;nbsp;million in the Paraíba Valley formation, the former is more economically viable.&lt;ref name=dyni/&gt;

The Irati Formation consists of two oil shale beds separated by {{convert|12|m|ft|-1}} of limestone and shale. The upper layer is thicker ({{convert|9|m|ft|-1}}) but the thinner lower bed ({{convert|4|m|ft|-1}}) is of greater value; the weight percent of shale oil yield is around 12% for the lower layer as compared to 7% for the upper one. The oil shale yield varies laterally, and may be as little as 7% for the lower layer and 4% for the upper layer. The formation is a very fine grained and laminated deposit ranging in color from dark gray to brown to black. While 60–70% of the shale consists of clay minerals, the balance is made up of organic matter.&lt;ref name=dyni/&gt; 

No consensus has been reached on the exact depositional nature of the Irati oil shale. One theory suggests that the organic material in the Irati oil shale originated from algae deposited in a lacustrine environment with salinity varying from that of [[freshwater]] to [[brackish water]]. Other theory suggests that the organic sediment may have been deposited in a shallow, partially restricted marine environment. Hutton's classification describes it as a marine source oil shale.&lt;ref name=dyni/&gt;

=== Formation in Estonia ===
The kukersite oil shale{{specify|date=August 2018}} of [[Ordovician]] age in [[Estonia]] is part of the Baltic oil shale basin and was deposited in shallow marine environments. The deposit is one of the world’s highest-grade deposits with more than 40% organic content and 66% conversion ratio into shale oil and gas. The oil shale is located in a single calcareous layer {{convert|2.5|to|3|m|ft}} in thickness and is buried at depths from {{convert|7|to|100|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=turkey/&gt; The total area of the basin is about {{convert|3000|km2|sqmi}}.&lt;ref name=arvoots/&gt; Oil yield from Kukersite is 30 to 47%. Most of the organic matter is derived from the fossil green alga, ''Gloeocapsomorpha prisca'', which has affinities to the modern [[Cyanobacteria|cyanobacterium]], ''[[Entophysalis major]]'', an extant species that forms [[algal mat]]s in inter-tidal to very shallow subtidal waters.&lt;ref name=bauert&gt;

Well-explored deposits, potentially classifiable as reserves, include the [[Green River Formation|Green River]] deposits in the western United States, the Tertiary{{specify|date=August 2018}} deposits in [[Queensland]], Australia, deposits{{specify|date=August 2018}} in [[Sweden]] and [[Estonia]], the El-Lajjun deposit in [[Jordan]], and deposits in France, Germany, [[Brazil]], China, southern [[Mongolia]] and Russia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1325">'''Pay''' is an expression used in [[hydrocarbon]] [[mining]]. It denotes a portion of a reservoir that contains economically recoverable hydrocarbons. The term derives from the possibility of  "paying" an income surpassing the costs. Equivalent terms are ''pay sand'' or ''pay zone''. Overall interval in which pay volumes occur is the '''gross pay'''; smaller portions of the reservoir that meet further criteria for pay (such as [[permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] and hydrocarbon saturation) are '''net pay'''.

Net pay is determined through placing cut offs on properties like permeability, porosity, water saturation or volume of shale. Care needs to be taken to cut out the part of the gross rock volume that has the ability to allow fluids to flow and '''actually stores''' hydrocarbons. In other cases when determining "Net Reservoir" the remaining rock is that rock that can still store flow hydrocarbons but is '''not necessary containing hydrocarbons'''. When the cut off is based on the ability of the rock to '''store hydrocarbons''' this is called "Net Rock".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epgeology.com/general-discussion-f29/ntg-defining-net-cut-offs-t5777.html Net to Gross Determination] at [http://www.epgeology.com/ Petroleum Geology Forums]&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeman, San Francisco {{ISBN|0-7167-1005-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Petroleum]] is generally considered oil and [[natural gas]]es having various compounds composed of primarily hydrogen and carbon.  They are usually generated from the decomposition and/or thermal maturation of [[organic matter]].  The organic matter originated from [[plant]]s and [[algae]].  The organic matter is deposited after the death of the plant in [[sediments]], where after considerable time, heat, and pressure the compounds in the plants and algae are altered to oil, gas, and [[kerogen]].  Kerogen can be thought of as the remaining solid material of the plant.  The sediment - usually [[clay]] and/or calcareous (lime) ooze, [[Lithification|hardens]] during this [[Diagenesis|alteration process]] into [[Rock (geology)|rock]] i.e. [[shale]] and/or [[limestone]].  The shale or limestone rock containing the organic matter is called the [[source rock]] because it is the source, having generated the petroleum.

In our quest to find more oil and gas, we use numerous petroleum [[Geochemistry|geochemical]] techniques to (1) identify source rocks and determine the amount, type, and maturation level of the organic matter; (2) evaluate the potential timing of petroleum migration from the source rock; (3) assess the potential migration pathways; and (4) correlate petroleum compounds found in reservoirs, leaks, and surface seeps to find new pools of petroleum. Some of the petroleum geochemical techniques used are: [[stable isotope]]s; hydrocarbon analysis (fingerprinting) of specific organic compounds (biological organic markers) with [[gas chromatography]] (GC) and gas chromatography-[[mass spectrometry]] (GC-MS); maturity indicators like [[vitrinite]] reflectance; laboratory [[pyrolysis]] and analysis; kerogen typing; and other more exotic techniques.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2580">{{short description|Earth scientist who works in geological aspects of oil discovery and production}}
A '''petroleum geologist''' is an [[earth scientist]] who works in the field of [[petroleum geology]], which involves all aspects of [[Hydrocarbon exploration|oil discovery]] and [[oil production|production]]. Petroleum geologists are usually linked to the actual discovery of oil and the identification of possible [[Oil field|oil deposits]] or leads. It can be a very labor-intensive task involving several different fields of science and elaborate equipment. Petroleum [[geologist]]s look at the structural and [[sediment]]ary aspects of the [[stratum]]/strata to identify possible [[oil trap]]s.

==Profile==
Petroleum geologists make the decision of where to [[oil drilling|drill for petroleum]]. This is done by locating prospects within a [[sedimentary basin]]. Petroleum geologists determine a prospect's viability looking at seven main aspects:

* '''Source''' – The presence of an organic-rich [[source rock]] capable of generating [[hydrocarbon]]s during deep burial.
* '''Reservoir''' – The usually [[porous rock]] unit that collects the hydrocarbons expelled from the source rock and holds them inside a trap.
* '''Seal''' – The rock unit that inhibits the oil or gas from escaping from a hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir rock.
* '''Trap''' – Structural or [[stratigraphic]] feature that captures migrating hydrocarbons into an economically producible accumulation.
* '''Timing''' – Geologic events must occur in a certain order, e.g. that the trap formed before migration rather than after.
* '''Maturation''' – The process of alteration a source rock under heat and pressure, leading to the cracking of its organic matter into oil and gas.
* '''Migration''' – The movement of the (less dense) oil or gas from the source rock into a reservoir rock and then into a trap.

These seven key aspects require the petroleum geologist to obtain a 4-dimensional idea of the subsurface (the three spatial dimensions, plus time). Data may be obtained via Geophysical methods. [[Geophysical survey]]s show the [[seismology]] data of [[Linear elasticity|elastic waves]], mainly [[seismic reflection]]. This provides a 3-dimensional look of the trap, and source rock. More data may be obtained from the [[mudlogger]], who analyzes the drill cuttings and the rock formation thicknesses.

'''Petroleum geology''' is the study of origin, occurrence, movement, accumulation, and exploration of hydrocarbon fuels. It refers to the specific set of geological disciplines that are applied to the search for [[hydrocarbons]] ([[oil exploration]]).

==Sedimentary basin analysis==
Petroleum geology is principally concerned with the evaluation of seven key elements in [[sedimentary basin]]s:

[[Image:OilReservoir.png|thumb|400px|A structural trap, where a fault has juxtaposed a porous and permeable reservoir against an impermeable seal. Oil (shown in red) accumulates against the seal, to the depth of the base of the seal. Any further oil migrating in from the source will escape to the surface and seep.]]
* [[Source rock|Source]]
* Reservoir
* Seal
* Trap
* Timing
* Maturation
* Migration

In general, all these elements must be assessed via a limited 'window' into the subsurface world, provided by one (or possibly more) exploration [[oil well|wells]].  These wells present only a 1-dimensional segment through the Earth and the skill of inferring 3-dimensional characteristics from them is one of the most fundamental in petroleum geology.  Recently, the availability of inexpensive, high quality 3D seismic data (from [[reflection seismology]]) and data from various electromagnetic geophysical techniques (such as [[Magnetotellurics]]) has greatly aided the accuracy of such interpretation.  The following section discusses these elements in brief.  For a more in-depth treatise, see the second half of this article below.

Evaluation of the '''source''' uses the methods of [[geochemistry]] to quantify the nature of organic-rich rocks which contain the precursors to hydrocarbons, such that the type and quality of expelled hydrocarbon can be assessed.  

The '''reservoir''' is a porous and permeable lithological unit or set of units that holds the hydrocarbon reserves.  Analysis of reservoirs at the simplest level requires an assessment of their [[porosity]] (to calculate the volume of ''in situ'' hydrocarbons) and their [[Permeability (fluid)|permeability]] (to calculate how easily hydrocarbons will flow out of them).  Some of the key disciplines used in reservoir analysis are the fields of [[#References|structural analysis]], [[stratigraphy]], [[sedimentology]], and [[reservoir engineering]].

The '''seal''', or ''cap'' rock, is a unit with low permeability that impedes the escape of hydrocarbons from the reservoir rock.  Common seals include [[evaporite]]s, [[chalk]]s and [[shale]]s.  Analysis of seals involves assessment of their thickness and extent, such that their effectiveness can be quantified.

The '''trap''' is the stratigraphic or structural feature that ensures the juxtaposition of reservoir and seal such that hydrocarbons remain trapped in the subsurface, rather than escaping (due to their natural [[buoyancy]]) and being lost.

Analysis of '''maturation''' involves assessing the thermal history of the source rock in order to make predictions of the amount and timing of hydrocarbon generation and expulsion.

Finally, careful studies of '''migration''' reveal information on how hydrocarbons move from source to reservoir and help quantify the source (or ''kitchen'') of hydrocarbons in a particular area.

==Major subdisciplines in petroleum geology==
Several major subdisciplines exist in petroleum geology specifically to study the seven key elements discussed above.

===Source rock analysis===
In terms of source rock analysis, several facts need to be established.  Firstly, the question of whether there actually ''is'' any source rock in the area must be answered.  Delineation and identification of potential source rocks depends on studies of the local [[stratigraphy]], [[palaeogeography]] and [[sedimentology]] to determine the likelihood of organic-rich sediments having been deposited in the past.

If the likelihood of there being a source rock is thought to be high, the next matter to address is the state of [[maturity (geology)|thermal maturity]] of the source, and the timing of maturation.  Maturation of source rocks (see [[diagenesis]] and [[fossil fuel]]s) depends strongly on temperature, such that the majority of oil generation occurs in the 60° to 120°C range.  Gas generation starts at similar temperatures, but may continue up beyond this range, perhaps as high as 200°C.  In order to determine the likelihood of oil/gas generation, therefore, the thermal history of the source rock must be calculated.  This is performed with a combination of geochemical analysis of the source rock (to determine the type of [[kerogen]]s present and their maturation characteristics) and [[basin modelling]] methods, such as [[back-stripping]], to model the [[temperature|thermal gradient]] in the sedimentary column.

===Basin analysis===
A full scale basin analysis is usually carried out prior to defining leads and prospects for future drilling. This study tackles the petroleum system and studies source rock (presence and quality); burial history; maturation (timing and volumes); migration and focus; and potential regional seals and major reservoir units (that define carrier beds). All these elements are used to investigate where potential hydrocarbons might migrate towards. Traps and potential leads and prospects are then defined in the area that is likely to have received hydrocarbons.

===Exploration stage===
Although a basin analysis is usually part of the first study a company conducts prior to moving into an area for future exploration, it is also sometimes conducted during the exploration phase. Exploration geology comprises all the activities and studies necessary for finding new hydrocarbon occurrence. Usually seismic (or 3D seismic) studies are shot, and old exploration data (seismic lines, well logs, reports) are used to expand upon the new studies. Sometimes gravity and magnetic studies are conducted, and oil seeps and spills are mapped to find potential areas for hydrocarbon occurrences. As soon as a significant hydrocarbon occurrence is found by an exploration- or wildcat-well the appraisal stage starts.

===Appraisal stage===
The Appraisal stage is used to delineate the extent of the discovery. Hydrocarbon reservoir properties, connectivity, hydrocarbon type and gas-oil and oil-water contacts are determined to calculate potential recoverable volumes. This is usually done by drilling more appraisal wells around the initial exploration well. Production tests may also give insight in reservoir pressures and connectivity. Geochemical and petrophysical analysis gives information on the type (viscosity, chemistry, API, carbon content, etc.) of the hydrocarbon and the nature of the reservoir (porosity, permeability, etc.).

===Production stage===
After a hydrocarbon occurrence has been discovered and appraisal has indicated it is a commercial find the production stage is initiated. This stage focuses on extracting the hydrocarbons in a controlled way (without damaging the formation, within commercial favorable volumes, etc.). Production wells are drilled and completed in strategic positions. 3D seismic is usually available by this stage to target wells precisely for optimal recovery. Sometimes enhanced recovery (steam injection, pumps, etc.) is used to extract more hydrocarbons or to redevelop abandoned fields.

===Reservoir analysis===
The existence of a reservoir rock (typically, sandstones and fractured limestones) is determined through a combination of regional studies (i.e. analysis of other wells in the area), stratigraphy and sedimentology (to quantify the pattern and extent of sedimentation) and seismic interpretation.  Once a possible hydrocarbon reservoir is identified, the key physical characteristics of a reservoir that are of interest to a hydrocarbon explorationist are its bulk rock volume, net-to-gross ratio, porosity and permeability.  

Bulk rock volume, or the gross rock volume of rock above any hydrocarbon-water contact, is determined by mapping and correlating sedimentary packages. The net-to-gross ratio, typically estimated from analogues and wireline logs, is used to calculate the proportion of the sedimentary packages that contains reservoir rocks. The bulk rock volume multiplied by the net-to-gross ratio gives the net rock volume of the reservoir. The net rock volume multiplied by porosity gives the total hydrocarbon pore volume i.e. the volume within the sedimentary package that fluids (importantly, hydrocarbons and water) can occupy. The summation of these volumes (see [[STOIIP]] and [[GIIP]]) for a given exploration prospect will allow explorers and commercial analysts to determine whether a prospect is financially viable.

Traditionally, porosity and permeability were determined through the study of drilling samples, analysis of cores obtained from the wellbore, examination of contiguous parts of the reservoir that outcrop at the surface (see e.g. [[#References|Guerriero et al., 2009, 2011]], in references below) and by the technique of [[formation evaluation]] using wireline tools passed down the well itself.  Modern advances in [[seismic]] [[data acquisition]] and processing have meant that [[seismic attribute]]s of subsurface rocks are readily available and can be used to infer physical/sedimentary properties of the rocks themselves.

In [[geology]], a '''petroleum play''', or simply a '''play''', is a group of [[oil field]]s or prospects in the same region that are controlled by the same set of geological circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter= North Sea petroleum plays|pages= 106|title= Introduction to Petroleum Exploration for Non-geologists|author= Robert Stoneley|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 1995|isbn= 0-19-854856-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is widely used in the realm of exploitation of hydrocarbon-based resources.

The play cycle normally exhibits the following steps:
# initial observations of a possible oil reserve
# testing and adjustments to initial estimates of extraction
# high success in locating and extracting oil from a reserve
# lower success as the reserve is depleted
# continued decrease in further exploration of the region

A particular [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] or [[Structural geology|structural]] geologic setting is also often known as a ''play.'' For example, in a relatively unexplored area (such as the [[Falkland Islands]]) one might speak of the "Paleozoic play" to refer to the potential oil reserves that might be found within [[Paleozoic]] strata.  In a well-explored basin such as the [[Gulf of Mexico]], explorers refer to the "Wilcox play" or the "Norphlet play" to collectively designate the production and possible production from those particular geological formations, of [[Paleocene]] and [[Jurassic]] age respectively&lt;ref&gt;https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2017/1111/ofr20171111.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.  

A play may also be a broad category of possible reservoirs or rock types, as in the [[turbidite]] play of offshore [[Angola]] or the carbonate play in the East [[Java Sea]], or to the structural geology of the setting, as in the ''sub-upthrust play'' of [[Wyoming]]. Sometimes the word ''play'' is applied to a geographic area with hydrocarbon potential, as the South Texas play or the Niger Delta play, but usually "play" is used with the sense of restricting discussion to exploring a particular geologic setting.  Thus one might have both the Wilcox play and the Norphlet play (among others) in partially overlapping areas of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico; the ''Gulf of Mexico deep-water play'' might or might not include elements or particular locations appropriate to either the Wilcox or the Norphlet, or both.  The term is one of convenience for discussion, and may refer to geologic time intervals, rock types, structures, or some combination of them.

In petroleum science, '''reservoir fluids''' are the fluids mixture contained within the [[petroleum reservoir]] which technically are placed in the reservoir rock. Reservoir fluids normally include liquid hydrocarbon (mainly [[Crude oil]]), aqueous solutions with dissolved salt, hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases such as [[methane]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]]&lt;ref name="www2.ggl.ulaval.ca"&gt;title=Formation Evaluation MSc Course Notes, Reservoir Fluids, Laval University, Canada | http://www2.ggl.ulaval.ca/personnel/paglover/CD%20Contents/Formation%20Evaluation%20English/Chapter%202.PDF | accessdate=October 19, 2013 |&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.

==Hydrocarbon liquids==

Hydrocarbon liquids such as [[Crude oil]] found in oil reservoirs formed in the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] from the left-over of once-living creatures. Evidence indicates that millions of years of heat and [[pressure]] changed the remains of [[microscopic]] [[plant]] and [[animal]] into oil and [[natural gas]].&lt;ref name="quote"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Making of Oil: Birth of a Reservoir | work= Schlumberger Excellence in Educational Development | url=http://www.seed.slb.com/en/scictr/watch/makingoi/birth/index.htm | accessdate=January 30, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051120073151/http://www.seed.slb.com/en/scictr/watch/makingoi/birth/index.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = November 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aqueous solutions==

Accumulations of hydrocarbons are invariably associated with aqueous fluids (formation waters), which may occur as extensive aquifers underlying or interdigitated with hydrocarbon bearing layers, but always occur within the hydrocarbon bearing layers as connate water.
These fluids are commonly saline, with a wide range of compositions and concentrations, however, there are examples of petroleum reservoirs in the world with fresh water.&lt;ref name="www2.ggl.ulaval.ca"/&gt;

==Gases==

The gaseous part of the reservoir fluids are both hydrocarbon gases (i.e. natural gas mostly including methane and butane) and non-hydrocarbon gases such as [[hydrogen sulfide]] and mercaptan containing components.&lt;ref&gt;Vatani, Ali. and Mokhatab, Saeed. "Principles of Hydraulic Design of Multiphase- Flow Transmission Pipelines". University of Tehran Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the pressure and temperature of the reservoir, the amount of dissolved in the liquid phase and free gases will be different.

In the oil and gas industry, '''reservoir modeling''' involves the construction of a [[computer model]] of a [[petroleum reservoir]], for the purposes of improving estimation of [[oil reserves|reserves]] and making decisions regarding the development of the field, predicting future production, placing additional wells, and evaluating alternative reservoir management scenarios. 

A reservoir model represents the physical space of the reservoir by an array of discrete cells, delineated by a grid which may be regular or irregular.  The array of cells is usually three-dimensional, although 1D and 2D models are sometimes used.  Values for attributes such as [[porosity]], [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] and [[water saturation]] are associated with each cell.  The value of each attribute is implicitly deemed to apply uniformly throughout the volume of the reservoir represented by the cell.

==Types of reservoir model==

Reservoir models typically fall into two categories:
* [[Geologic modelling|Geological models]] are created by [[geologist]]s and [[geophysicist]]s and aim to provide a static description of the reservoir, prior to production.
* [[Reservoir simulation]] models are created by [[reservoir engineering|reservoir engineers]] and use [[finite difference methods]] to simulate the flow of fluids within the reservoir, over its production lifetime.

Sometimes a single "shared earth model" is used for both purposes.  More commonly, a geological model is constructed at a relatively high (fine) resolution.  A coarser grid for the reservoir simulation model is constructed, with perhaps two orders of magnitude fewer cells.  Effective values of attributes for the simulation model are then derived from the geological model by an upscaling process. Alternatively, if no geological model exists, the attribute values for a simulation model may be determined by a process of sampling geological maps.

Uncertainty in the true values of the reservoir properties is sometimes investigated by constructing several different [[Realization (probability)|realizations]] of the sets of attribute values.  The behaviour of the resulting simulation models can then indicate the associated level of economic uncertainty.

The phrase "reservoir characterization" is sometimes used to refer to reservoir modeling activities up to the point when a simulation model is ready to simulate the flow of fluids.

Commercially available software is used in the construction, simulation and analysis of the reservoir models.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Tyson. ''An Introduction to Reservoir Modeling'' (2007), {{ISBN|978-1-906928-07-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seismic to simulation==
The processes required to construct reservoir models are described by the phrase ''Seismic to simulation''. The process is successful if the model accurately reflects the original [[well logging|well logs]], seismic data and production history.

Reservoir models are constructed to gain a better understanding of the subsurface that leads to informed well placement, reserves estimation and [[production planning]]. Models are based on measurements taken in the field, including well logs, [[Reflection seismology|seismic surveys]], and production history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RETINA Homepage|url=http://www.estdco.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Seismic to simulation enables the quantitative integration of all field data into an updateable reservoir model built by a team of geologists, geophysicists, and engineers. Key techniques used in the process include integrated [[Reservoir petrophysics|petrophysics]] and rock physics to determine the range of lithotypes and rock properties, [[geostatistics|geostatistical]] inversion to determine a set of plausible seismic-derived rock property models at sufficient vertical resolution and heterogeneity for flow simulation, [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] grid transfer to accurately move seismic-derived data to the geologic model, and flow simulation for model validation and ranking to determine the model that best fits all the data.

===Rock physics and petrophysics===

The first step in seismic to simulation is establishing a relationship between petrophysical key rock properties and [[Elastic modulus|elastic properties]] of the rock. This is required in order to find common ground between the well logs and seismic data.&lt;ref&gt;"Benefits of Integrating Rock Physics with Petrophysics: Five Key Reasons to Employ an Integrated, Iterative Workflow", Fugro-Jason White Paper, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Well logs are measured in depth and provide high resolution vertical data, but no insight into the inter-well space. Seismic are measured in time and provide great lateral detail but is quite limited in its vertical resolution. When correlated, well logs and seismic can be used to create a fine-scale 3D model of the subsurface.

Insight into the rock properties comes from a combination of basic geologic understanding and well-bore measurements. Based on an understanding of how the area was formed over time, geologists can predict the types of rock likely to be present and how rapidly they vary spatially. Well log and [[Core sample|core measurements]] provide samples to verify and fine-tune that understanding. 

Seismic data is used by petrophysicists to identify the tops of various lithotypes and the distribution of rock properties in the inter-well space using seismic inversion attributes such as [[acoustic impedance|impedance]]. Seismic surveys measure acoustic impedance contrasts between rock layers. As different geologic structures are encountered, the sound wave [[Reflection seismology|reflects]] and [[refraction|refracts]] as a function of the impedance contrast between the layers. Acoustic impedance varies by rock type and can therefore be correlated to rock properties using rock physics relationships between the inversion attributes and petrophysical properties such as [[porosity]], [[lithology]], [[Water content|water saturation]], and [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]].

Once well logs are properly conditioned and edited, a petrophysical rock model is generated that can be used to derive the effective elastic rock properties from fluid and mineral parameters as well as rock structure information. The model parameters are calibrated by comparison of the synthetic to the available elastic [[sonic logging|sonic]] logs. Calculations are performed following a number of rock physics [[algorithm]]s including: Xu &amp; White, Greenberg &amp; Castagna, Gassmann, Gardner, modified upper and lower Hashin-Shtrikman, and Batzle &amp; Wang. 

When the petrophysical rock model is complete, a statistical database is created to describe the rock types and their known properties such as porosity and permeability. Lithotypes are described, along with their distinct elastic properties.

===MCMC geostatistical inversion===

In the next step of seismic to simulation, seismic inversion techniques combine well and seismic data to produce multiple equally plausible 3D models of the elastic properties of the reservoir. Seismic data is transformed to elastic property log(s) at every trace. Deterministic inversion techniques are used to provide a good overall view of the porosity over the field, and serve as a quality control check. To obtain greater detail needed for complex geology, additional stochastic inversion is then employed.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, A., "Limitations of Deterministic and Advantages of Stochastic Seismic Inversion", CSEG Records, February 2005, p. 5-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geostatistical inversion procedures detect and delineate thin reservoirs otherwise poorly defined.&lt;ref&gt;Merletti, G., Torres-Verdin, C., "Accurate Detection and Spatial Delineation of Thin-Sand Sedimentary Sequences via Joint Stochastic Inversion of Well Logs and 3D Pre-Stack Seismic Amplitude Data", SPE 102444.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] (MCMC) based geostatistical inversion addresses the vertical scaling problem by creating seismic derived rock properties with vertical sampling compatible to geologic models.

All field data is incorporated into the geostatistical inversion process through the use of [[probability distribution function]]s (PDFs). Each PDF describes a particular input data in geostatistical terms using [[histogram]]s and [[variogram]]s, which identify the odds of a given value at a specific place and the overall expected scale and texture based on geologic insight.

Once constructed, the PDFs are combined using [[Bayesian inference]], resulting in a posterior PDF that conforms to everything that is known about the field.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;"Incorporating Geophysics into Geologic Models: New Approach Makes Geophysical Models Available to Engineers in a Form They Can Use", Fugro-Jason White Paper, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A weighting system is used within the algorithm, making the process more objective.

From the posterior PDF, realizations are generated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. These realizations are statistically fair and produce models of high detail, accuracy and realism. Rock properties like porosity can be cosimulated from the elastic properties determined by the geostatistical inversion. This process is iterated until a best fit model is identified.

Inversion parameters are tuned by running the inversion many times with and without well data. Without the well data, the inversions are running in blind-well mode. These blind-well mode inversions test the reliability of the constrained inversion and remove potential bias. 

This statistical approach creates multiple, equi-probable models consistent with the seismic, wells, and geology. Geostatistical inversion simultaneously inverts for impedance and discrete properties types, and other petrophysical properties such as porosity can then be jointly cosimulated. 

The output volumes are at a sample rate consistent with the reservoir model because making synthetics of finely sampled models is the same as from well logs. Inversion properties are consistent with well log properties because the histograms used to generate the output rock properties from the inversion are based on well log values for those rock properties.

Uncertainty is quantified by using random seeds to generate slightly differing realizations, particularly for areas of interest. This process improves the understanding of uncertainty and risk within the model.

===Stratigraphic grid transfer===

Following geostatistical inversion and in preparation for history matching and flow simulation, the static model is re-gridded and up-scaled. The  transfer simultaneously converts time to depth for the various properties and transfers them in 3D from the [[seismic grid]] to a [[corner-point grid]]. The relative locations of properties are preserved, ensuring data points in the seismic grid arrive in the correct stratigraphic layer in the corner point grid.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The static model built from seismic is typically orthogonal but flow simulators expect corner point grids. The corner point grid consists of cubes that are usually much coarser in the horizontal direction and each corner of the cube is arbitrarily defined to follow the major features in the grid. Converting directly from orthogonal to corner point can cause problems such as creating discontinuity in fluid flow. 

An intermediate stratigraphic grid ensures that important structures are not misrepresented in the transfer. The stratigraphic grid has the same number of cells as the orthogonal seismic grid, but the boundaries are defined by stratigraphic surfaces and the cells follow the stratigraphic organization. This is a stratigraphic representation of the seismic data using the seismic interpretation to define the layers. The stratigraphic grid model is then mapped to the corner point grid by adjusting the zones.

Using the porosity and permeability models and a saturation height function, initial saturation models are built. If volumetric calculations identify problems in the model, changes are made in the petrophysical model without causing the model to stray from the original input data. For example, sealing faults are added for greater compartmentalization.

===Model validation and ranking===

In the last step of seismic to simulation, flow simulation continues the integration process by bringing in the production history. This provides a further validation of the static model against history. A representative set of the model realizations from the geostatistical inversion are history matched against production data. If the properties in the model are realistic, simulated well bottom hole pressure behavior should match historical (measured) well bottom hole pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Castoro A., de Groot L. , Forsyth D., Maguire R., Rijkers R., Webber R., "Accurate Reservoir Modelling Through Optimized Integration of Geostatistical Inversion And Flow Simulation. A North Sea Case Study", Petex, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Production flow rates and other engineering data should also match. 

Based on the quality of the match, some models are eliminated. After the initial history match process, dynamic well parameters are adjusted as needed for each of the remaining models to improve the match. The final model represents the best match to original field measurements and production data and is then used in drilling decisions and production planning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2072">{{Well logging}}
'''Resistivity logging''' is a method of [[well logging]] that works by characterizing the rock or sediment in a [[borehole]] by measuring its [[resistivity|electrical resistivity]]. Resistivity is a fundamental material property which represents how strongly a material opposes the flow of [[electric current]]. In these logs, resistivity is measured using [[Four-terminal_sensing|4 electrical probes]] to eliminate the resistance of the contact leads. The log must run in holes containing electrically conductive mud or water.

Resistivity logging is sometimes used in [[mineral exploration]] (especially exploration for  [[iron]] and [[potassium]]) and water-well drilling, but most commonly for [[formation evaluation]] in oil- and gas-well drilling. Most rock materials are essentially [[Insulator (electricity)|insulators]], while their enclosed fluids are [[Electrical conduction|conductors]]. Hydrocarbon fluids are an exception, because they are almost infinitely resistive. When a formation is porous and contains salty water, the overall resistivity will be low. When the formation contains hydrocarbon, or contains very low porosity, its resistivity will be high. High resistivity values may indicate a hydrocarbon bearing formation.

Usually while drilling, [[drilling fluid invasion|drilling fluids invade]] the formation, changes in the resistivity are measured by the tool in the invaded zone.  For this reason, several resistivity tools with different investigation lengths are used to measure the formation resistivity.  If water based [[drilling mud|mud]] is used and oil is displaced, "deeper" resistivity logs (or those of the "virgin zone") will show lower conductivity than the invaded zone.  If oil based mud is used and water is displaced, deeper logs will show higher conductivity than the invaded zone.  This provides not only an indication of the fluids present, but also, at least qualitatively, whether the formation is permeable or not.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6074">'''Conrad Schlumberger''' (2 October 1878 in [[Guebwiller]] ([[Alsace]]) – 9 May 1936 in [[Stockholm]]) and '''Emile Henry Marcel Schlumberger''' (21 June 1884 in [[Guebwiller]] – 9 May 1953 in Val-Richer) were brothers from the region of [[Alsace]], [[France]], then a part of the [[German Empire]]. Their inventions in the area of [[geophysics]] and [[well logging]] were the beginnings of [[Schlumberger|Schlumberger Well Services]] and the entire well logging industry.

==Life and work==
Conrad and Marcel were two of six children of an affluent Alsatian [[Protestantism in France|Protestant]] family. Their father, Paul, was descended from a wealthy cotton weaving family.  Their mother, Marguerite De Witt, was a political activist.  When the brothers were born, their native province Alsace was part of [[Germany]].  Their parents decided to send the brothers to Paris to be educated. Both Conrad and Marcel were educated at the top engineering schools in France; Conrad graduated from [[École Polytechnique]] in 1900, whereas Marcel graduated from [[École Centrale Paris]] in 1907.

Conrad initially worked as a mining engineer at [[Rodez]] and [[Toulouse]], and Marcel pursued a career as a railway engineer before participating in the construction of the first French tanks during the [[World War I|first World War]].  In 1912, Conrad, then a professor at the [[École des Mines de Paris]] conceived the idea of prospecting for metal [[ore]] deposits by using the [[electrical conductivity]] of ore rocks to distinguish them from the less conductive surrounding country rocks.  One of the first tests was performed in a bathtub which was filled with various rocks for the experiments.  In 1919, the brothers signed an agreement with their father in which their father would support their scientific research.  These experiments led to an electrical surface-measuring system for mineral exploration known as a "[[Schlumberger array]]."

In 1923, the brothers began conducting geophysical surveys in various countries including Romania, Serbia, Canada, [[Union of South Africa]], [[Belgian Congo]], and the United States.  In 1926, [[Henri George Doll]] (Conrad's brother-in-law) joined the group.  In 1926, the brothers formed [[Société de Prospection Electrique]] to develop the theory that adding [[resistivity]] information from deeper formations would increase the effectiveness of the surface prospecting technique.  The first office was in [[Paris]] on the rue Fabert.

On 5 September 1927, Henri George Doll and several field engineers ran the first wireline [[electric log]].  This log was of the Diefenbach #2905 well, Rig 7 of the [[Pechelbronn]] Oil Company at [[Merkwiller-Pechelbronn]] in the [[Bas-Rhin]].  The well was about 500 meters deep but only the interval from 130m to 270m was logged.  A measurement was made every meter.  The equipment was stopped, and the logging cable was connected to the surface potentiometer and to a battery power supply to make a measurement.  The logging rate was about 50 meters per hour.  The Schlumberger brothers called this technique an "Electrical Survey", but the more common name "[[well log]]" was coined a few years later in the United States.

At that time, [[Pechelbronn]] was the only oil field known in France.  On 28 July 1928, the owners of the oil field signed a contract with the [[Schlumberger]] company to do oil well logging.  The first contract was for 12,000 [[Franc]]s (about $2600 US [[dollars]]) per month.  This was the first [[well logging]] program.

The Schlumberger company then tried to expand their activities to many other countries, but the attempts were hindered by the [[Great Depression|worldwide depression]].  On 15 September 1934, Schlumberger's subsidiary in the United States became [[Schlumberger Well Surveying Corporation]] (SWSC) with offices in [[Houston, Texas]].  Conrad was the chairman, and Marcel was the president.  In 1936, Conrad died of a heart attack while returning from a business trip to the Soviet Union.  During the German occupation of France, the company headquarters was moved from Paris to Houston.  Marcel died in 1953. After World War II, Marcel's son Pierre Schlumberger took over the American company.  Pierre Schlumberger was married to the eccentric Sao Schlumberger, who was for some years the biggest individual customer of haute couture clothing.

In 1955, in recognition of Conrad Schlumberger's outstanding contribution to exploration geophysics, The European Association of Exploration Geophysicists (now European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers) established a [[Conrad Schlumberger Award]]. Each year the Award is presented to a member of the Association who has made an outstanding contribution over a period of time to the scientific and technical advancement of the geosciences, particularly geophysics. Notable recipients of the award include [[Nigel Anstey]], [[Les Hatton]] and [[Michael Schoenberg]], among others.

Marcel Schlumberger's great-great-granddaughter is actress [[Léa Seydoux]].

'''Seismic [[anisotropy]]''' is a term used in [[seismology]] to describe the directional dependence of the velocity of [[seismic wave]]s in a medium ([[rock (geology)|rock]]) within the [[Earth]].

==Description==
A [[Materials science|material]] is said to be anisotropic if the value of one or more of its properties varies with direction. Anisotropy differs from the property called heterogeneity in that anisotropy is the variation in values with direction at a point while heterogeneity is the variation in values between two or more points.

Seismic Anisotropy can be defined as the dependence of seismic velocity on direction or upon angle.&lt;ref&gt;Thomsen, L. (2002). Understanding seismic anisotropy in exploration and exploitation. SEG-EAGE Distinguished Instructor Series 5. Society of Exploration Geophysicists.&lt;/ref&gt; General anisotropy is described by a 4th order elasticity tensor with 21 independent elements. However, in practice observational studies are unable to distinguish all 21 elements, and anisotropy is usually simplified. In the simplest form, there are two main types of anisotropy, both of them are called [[transverse isotropy]] (it is called transverse isotropy because there is isotropy in either the horizontal or vertical plane) or polar anisotropy. The difference between them is in their axis of symmetry, which is an axis of rotational invariance such that if we rotate the formation about the axis, the material is still indistinguishable from what it was before. The symmetry axis is usually associated with regional stress or gravity.
* TIV- transverse isotropy with a vertical axis of symmetry, this is also called VTI (vertical transverse isotropy). This kind of anisotropy is associated with [[bedding|layering]] and [[shale]] and is found where [[gravity]] is the dominant factor.
* TIH- transverse isotropy with a horizontal axis of symmetry, this is also called HTI (horizontal transverse isotropy). This kind of anisotropy is associated with cracks and fractures and is found where regional stress is the dominant factor.

The transverse anisotropic matrix has the same form as the isotropic matrix, except that it has five non-zero values distributed among 12 non-zero elements.

Transverse isotropy is sometimes called transverse anisotropy or anisotropy with hexagonal symmetry. In many cases the axis of symmetry will be neither horizontal nor vertical, in which case it is often called "tilted".&lt;ref&gt;Savage, M. (1999). Seismic anisotropy and mantle deformation: What have we learned from shear wave splitting? Reviews of Geophysics, Vol. 37, pp. 65-109, 1999, doi.org/10.1029/98RG02075&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the recognition of anisotropy==
Anisotropy dates back to the 19th century following the theory of Elastic wave propagation. [[George Green (mathematician)|Green]] (1838) and [[Lord Kelvin]] (1856) took anisotropy into account in their articles on wave propagation. Anisotropy entered [[seismology]] in the late 19th century and was introduced by [[Maurycy Pius Rudzki|Maurice Rudzki]]. From 1898 till his death in 1916, [[Maurycy Pius Rudzki|Rudzki]] attempted to advance the theory of anisotropy, he attempted to determine the wavefront of a transversely isotropic medium (TI) in 1898 and in 1912 and 1913 he wrote on surface waves in transversely isotropic half space and on Fermat's principle in anisotropic media respectively.

With all these, the advancement of anisotropy was still slow and in the first 30 years (1920-1950) of exploration seismology only a few papers were written on the subject. More work was done by several scientists such as [[Helbig]] (1956) who observed while doing seismic work on [[Devonian]] [[schist]]s that velocities along the foliation were about 20% higher than those across the foliation. However the appreciation of anisotropy increased with the proposition of a new model for the generation of anisotropy in an originally isotropic background and a new exploration concept by Crampin (1987). One of the main points by Crampin was that the polarization of three component shear waves carries unique information about the internal structure of the rock through which they pass, and that [[shear wave splitting]] may contain information about the distribution of [[fracture (geology)|crack]] orientations.

With these new developments and the acquisition of better and new types of data such as three component 3D [[Reflection seismology|seismic data]], which clearly show the effects of shear wave splitting, and wide Azimuth 3D data which show the effects of Azimuthal anisotropy, and the availability of more powerful computers, anisotropy began to have great impact in [[hydrocarbon exploration|exploration]] seismology in the past three decades.

==Concept of seismic anisotropy==
Since the understanding of seismic anisotropy is closely tied to the shear wave splitting, we begin this section by discussing shear wave splitting.

Shear waves have been observed to split into two or more fixed polarizations which can propagate in the particular ray direction when entering an anisotropic medium. These split phases propagate with different polarizations and velocities. Crampin (1984) amongst others gives evidence that many rocks are anisotropic for shear wave propagation. In addition, shear wave splitting is almost routinely observed in three-component [[Vertical seismic profile|VSPs]]. Such shear wave splitting can be directly analyzed only on three component geophones recording either in the subsurface, or within the effective shear window at the free surface if there are no near surface low-velocity layers. Observation of these shear waves show that measuring the orientation and polarization of the first arrival and the delay between these split shear waves reveal the orientation of cracks and the crack density . This is particularly important in reservoir characterization.

In a linearly elastic material, which can be described by [[Hooke's law]] as one in which each component of stress is dependent on every component of strain, the following relationship exists:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij} = C_{ijkl} e_{kl} \quad i,j,k,l = 1,2,3&lt;/math&gt;

where ''σ'' is the stress, ''C'' is the [[elastic modulus|elastic moduli]] or stiffness constant, and ''e'' is the strain.

The elastic modulus matrix for an anisotropic case is
:&lt;math&gt;
\underline{\underline{\mathsf{C}}} =
\begin{bmatrix}
C_{11} &amp; C_{11} - 2C_{66} &amp; C_{13} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
C_{11} - 2C_{66} &amp; C_{11} &amp; C_{13} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
C_{13} &amp; C_{13} &amp; C_{33} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; C_{44} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; C_{44} &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; C_{66} \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
The above is the elastic modulus for a vertical transverse isotropic medium (VTI), which is the usual case. The elastic modulus for a horizontal transverse isotropic medium (HTI) is;
:&lt;math&gt;
\underline{\underline{\mathsf{C}}} =
\begin{bmatrix}
C_{11} &amp; C_{13} &amp; C_{13} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
C_{13} &amp; C_{33} &amp; C_{33} - 2C_{44} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
C_{13} &amp; C_{33} - 2C_{44} &amp; C_{33} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; C_{44} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; C_{66} &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; C_{66} \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;
For an anisotropic medium, the directional dependence of the three phase velocities can be written by applying the elastic moduli in the wave equation is;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nye|first= J. F.|year=2000|title=Physical Properties of Crystals: Their Representation by Tensors and Matrices | publisher= Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; The direction dependent [[Signal velocity|wave speeds]] for [[elastic wave]]s through the material can be found by using the [[Linear elasticity|Christoffel equation]] and are given by&lt;ref&gt;G.

    V_{p}(\theta)    &amp;= \sqrt{\frac{C_{11} \sin^2(\theta) + C_{33}

&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\theta\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the axis of symmetry and the wave propagation direction, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is mass density and the &lt;math&gt;C_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are elements of the [[linear elasticity#Anisotropic homogeneous media|elastic stiffness matrix]]. The Thomsen parameters are used to simplify these expressions and make them easier to understand.

Seismic anisotropy has been observed to be weak, and Thomsen (1986)&lt;ref name="T86"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thomsen|first= Leon|year=1986|title=Weak Elastic Anisotropy |journal=Geophysics |volume=51|issue= 10|pages=1954–66 |doi=10.1190/1.1442051 |bibcode = 1986Geop...51.1954T }}&lt;/ref&gt; rewrote the velocities above in terms of their deviation from the vertical velocities as follows;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
     V_{P}(\theta) &amp; \approx V_{P0}(1 + \delta \sin^2 \theta \cos^2 \theta + \epsilon \sin^4 \theta) \\
     V_{SV}(\theta) &amp; \approx V_{S0}\left[1 + \left(\frac{V_{P0}}{ V_{S0}}\right)^2(\epsilon-\delta) \sin^2 \theta \cos^2 \theta\right] \\
     V_{SH}(\theta) &amp; \approx V_{S0}(1 + \gamma \sin^2 \theta )
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;
  V_{P0}= \sqrt{C_{33}/\rho} ~;~~ V_{S0}= \sqrt{C_{44}/\rho}
&lt;/math&gt;
are the P and S wave velocities in the direction of the axis of symmetry (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_3&lt;/math&gt;) (in geophysics, this is usually, but not always, the vertical direction). Note that &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; may be further linearized, but this does not lead to further simplification.

The approximate expressions for the wave velocities are simple enough to be physically interpreted, and sufficiently accurate for most geophysical applications. These expressions are also useful in some contexts where the anisotropy is not weak.

The Thomsen parameters are anisotropic and are three non-dimensional combinations which reduce to zero in isotropic cases, and are defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
     \epsilon &amp; = \frac{C_{11} - C_{33}}{ 2C_{33} } \\
     \delta &amp; = \frac{(C_{13} + C_{44})^2-(C_{33} - C_{44})^2}{ 2C_{33}(C_{33} - C_{44}) } \\
     \gamma &amp; = \frac{C_{66} - C_{44}}{ 2C_{44} }
  \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Origin of anisotropy==
Anisotropy has been reported to occur in the Earth's three main layers; the [[crust (geology)|crust]], [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] and the [[core (geology)|core]].

The origin of seismic anisotropy is non-unique, a range of phenomena may cause Earth materials to display seismic anisotropy. The anisotropy may be strongly dependent on wavelength if it is due to the average properties of aligned or partially aligned heterogeneity. A solid has intrinsic anisotropy when it is homogeneously and sinuously anisotropic down to the smallest particle size, which may be due to crystalline anisotropy. Relevant crystallographic anisotropy can be found in the [[upper mantle (Earth)|upper mantle]]. When an otherwise isotropic rock contains a distribution of dry or liquid-filled cracks which have preferred orientation it is named crack induced anisotropy. The presence of aligned cracks, open or filled with some different material, is an important mechanism at shallow depth, in the crust. It is well known that the small-scale, or microstructural, factors include (e.g. Kern &amp; Wenk 1985; Mainprice et al. 2003): (1) crystal lattice preferred orientation (LPO) of constituent mineral phases; (2) variations in spatial distribution of grains and minerals; (3) grain morphology and (4) aligned fractures, cracks and pores, and the nature of their infilling material (e.g. clays, hydrocarbons, water, etc.). Because of the overall microstructural control on seismic anisotropy, it follows that anisotropy can be diagnostic for specific rock types. Here, we consider whether seismic anisotropy can be used as an indicator of specific [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] [[lithology|lithologies]] within the Earth's crust.
In sedimentary rocks, anisotropy develops during and after deposition. For anisotropy to develop, there needs to be some degree of homogeneity or uniformity from point to point in the deposited clastics. During deposition, anisotropy is caused by the periodic layering associated with changes in sediment type which produces materials of different grain size, and also by the directionality of the transporting medium which tends to order the grains under gravity by grain sorting. Fracturing and some [[diagenesis|diagenetic]] processes such as [[compaction (geology)|compaction]] and dewatering of [[Clay minerals|clays]], and alteration etc. are post depositional processes that can cause anisotropy .

==The importance of anisotropy in hydrocarbon exploration and production==
In the past two decades, the seismic anisotropy has dramatically been gaining attention from academic and industry, due to advances in anisotropy parameter estimation, the transition from post stack imaging to pre stack depth migration, and the wider offset and azimuthal coverage of 3D surveys. Currently, many seismic processing and inversion methods utilize anisotropic models, thus providing a significant enhancement over the seismic imaging quality and resolution. The integration of anisotropy velocity model with seismic imaging has reduced uncertainty on internal and bounding-[[fault (geology)|fault]] positions, thus greatly reduce the risk of investment decision based heavily on seismic interpretation.

In addition, the establishment of correlation between anisotropy parameters, fracture orientation, and density, lead to practical reservoir characterization techniques. The acquisition of such information, fracture spatial distribution and density, the drainage area of each producing well can be dramatically increased if taking the fractures into account during the drilling decision process. The increased drainage area per well will result in fewer wells, greatly reducing the drilling cost of exploration and production (E&amp;P) projects.

==The application of the anisotropy in petroleum exploration and production==
Among several applications of seismic anisotropy, the following are the most important: anisotropic parameter estimation, prestack depth anisotropy migration, and fracture characterization based on anisotropy velocity models.

===Anisotropy parameter estimation===
The anisotropy parameter is most fundamental to all other anisotropy application in E&amp;P area. In the early days of seismic petroleum exploration, the geophysicists were already aware of the anisotropy-induced distortion in [[P-wave]] imaging (the major of petroleum exploration seismic surveys). Although the anisotropy-induced distortion is less significant since the poststack processing of narrow-azimuth data is not sensitive to velocity. The advancement of seismic anisotropy is largely contributed by the Thomsen's work on anisotropy notation and also by the discovery of the P-wave time-process parameter &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; . These fundamental works enable to parametrize the transverse isotropic (TI) models with only three parameters, while there are five full independent stiff tensor element in transverse isotropic (VTI or HTI) models. This simplification made the measurement of seismic anisotropy a plausible approach.

Most anisotropy parameter estimation work is based on shale and [[silt]]s, which may be due to the fact that shale and silts are the most abundant sedimentary rocks in the Earth's crust. Also in the context of [[petroleum geology]], organic shale is the [[source rock]] as well as seal rocks that trap oil and gas. In seismic exploration, shales represent the majority of the wave propagation medium overlying the petroleum [[reservoir (geology)|reservoir]]. In conclusion, seismic properties of shale are important for both exploration and reservoir management.

Seismic velocity anisotropy in shale can be estimated from several methods, including deviated-well sonic logs, walkway VSP, and core measurement. These methods have their own advantages and disadvantages: the walkway VSP method suffers from scaling issues, and core measure is impractical for shale, since shale is hard to be cored during drilling.

====Walkway VSP====
The Walkway VSP array several seismic surface sources at different offset from the well. Meanwhile, a vertical receiver array with constant interval between receivers is mounted in a vertical well. The sound arrival times between multiple surface sources and receivers at multiple depths are recorded during measurement. These arrival times are used to derive the anisotropy parameter based on the following equations
:&lt;math&gt;t^2 (x)=t_0^2 + \frac{x^2}{V_{nmo}^2 } -\frac{2\eta x^4}{V_{nmo}^2 ([t_0^2 V]_{nmo}^2+(1+2\eta)x^2)}&lt;/math&gt;
Where &lt;math&gt;t(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the arrival time from source with &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; offset, &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the arrival time of zero offset, &lt;math&gt;V_{nmo}&lt;/math&gt; is NMO velocity, &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is Thompson anisotropy parameter.

The layout of surface sources and receivers positions is shown in the following diagram.

====Core measurement====
Another technique used to estimate the anisotropy parameter is directly measure them from the core which is extracted through a special hollow drill bit during drill process. Since coring a sample will generate large extra cost, only limited number of core samples can be obtained for each well. Thus the anisotropy parameter obtained through core measurement technique only represent the anisotropy property of rock near the borehole at just several specific depth, rending this technique often provides little help on the field seismic survey application. The measurements on each shale plug require at least one week.
From the context of this article, wave propagation in a vertically transverse medium can be described with five elastic constants, and ratios among these parameters define the rock anisotropy . This anisotropy parameter can be obtained in the laboratory by measuring the velocity travel speed with transducer ultrasonic systems at variable saturation and pressure conditions. Usually, three directions of wave propagation on core samples are the minimum requirement to estimate the five elastic coefficients of the stiffness tensor. Each direction in core plug measurement yields three velocities (one P and two S).

The variation of wave propagation direction can be achieved by either cutting three samples at 0°, 45° and 90° from the cores or by using one core plug with transducers attached at these three angles. Since most shales are very friable and fissured, it is often difficult to cut shale core plug. Its edges break off easily. Thus the cutting sample method can only be used for hard, competent rocks. The cutting position of samples can be explained by the following diagram.

Another way to get the wave propagation velocity at three directions is to arrange the ultrasonic transducer onto several specific location of the core sampler. This method avoids the difficulties encounter during the cutting of shale core sample. It also reduces the time of measurement by two thirds since three pairs of ultrasonic transducer work at the same time. The following diagram gives us a clear image on the arrangement of the transducers.

Once the velocities at three directions are measured by one of the above two methods, the five independent elastic constants are given by the following equations:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;C_{33} = \rho V_{P}^2(0^\circ)\\
&amp;C_{11}=\rho V_{P}^2(90^\circ)\\
&amp;C_{55}=\rho V_{SH}^2(90^\circ)\\
&amp;C_{66}=\rho V_{SV}^2(90^\circ)\\
&amp;C_{13}=\left[\frac{(4\rho V_{P}^2(45^\circ) - C_{11} - C_{33} - 2C_{44} )^2-[(C_{11}-C_{33})]^2}{4}\right]^{1/2} - C_{44}\\
&amp;\epsilon=\frac{C_{11}-C_{33}}{2C_{33} }\\
&amp;\gamma=\frac{C_{66}-C_{44}}{2C_{44} }\\
&amp;\delta=\frac{(C_{13}+C_{44})^2 - (C_{33}-C_{44})^2}{2C_{33} (C_{33}-C_{44})}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
The P-wave anisotropy of a VTI medium can be described by using Thomsen's parameters &lt;math&gt; \epsilon, \delta&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; quantifies the velocity difference for wave propagation along and perpendicular to the symmetry axis, while &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; controls the P-wave propagation for angles near the symmetry axis.

====Deviated well sonic log====
The last technique can be used to measure the seismic anisotropy is related to the sonic logging information of a deviated well. In a deviated well, the wave propagation velocity is higher than the wave propagation velocity in a vertical well at the same depth. This difference in velocity between deviated well and vertical well reflects the anisotropy parameters of the rocks near the borehole. The detail of this technique will be shown on an example of this report.

===Anisotropic prestack depth migration===
In the situation of complex geology, e.g. faulting, folding, fracturing, salt bodies, and unconformities, pre-stack migration (PreSM) is used due to better resolution under such complex geology. In PreSM, all traces are migrated before being moved to zero-offset. As a result, much more information is used, which results in a much better image, along with the fact that PreSM honours velocity changes more accurately than post-stack migration. The PreSM is extremely sensitive to the accuracy of the velocity field. Thus the inadequacy of isotropic velocity models is not suitable for the pre stack depth migration. P-wave anisotropic prestack depth migration (APSDM) can produce a seismic image that is very accurate in depth and space. As a result, unlike isotropic PSDM, it is consistent with well data and provides an ideal input for reservoir characterization studies. However, this accuracy can only be achieved if correct anisotropy parameters are used. These parameters cannot be estimated from seismic data alone. They can only be determined with confidence through analysis of a variety of geoscientific material – borehole data and geological history.

During recent years, the industry has started to see the practical use of anisotropy in seismic imaging. We show case studies that illustrate this integration of the geosciences. We show that much better accuracy is being achieved. The logical conclusion is that, this integrated approach should extend the use of anisotropic depth imaging from complex geology only, to routine application on all reservoirs.

===Fracture characterization===
After considering applications of anisotropy that improved seismic imaging, two approaches for exploiting anisotropy for the analysis of fractures in the formation are worthy of discussing. Ones uses azimuthal variations in the amplitude versus offset (AVO) signature when the wave is reflected from the top or base of an anisotropic material, and a second exploits the polarizing effect that the fractures have on a transmitted shear-wave. In both cases, the individual fractures are below the resolving power of the seismic signal and it is the cumulative effect of the fracturing that is recorded. Based on the idea behind them, both approaches can be divided into two steps. The first step is to get the anisotropy parameters from seismic signals, and the second steps is to retreat the information of fractures from anisotropy parameters based on the fracture induce anisotropy model.

====Fractures-azimuthal variations====
Aligned subseismic-scale fracturing can produce seismic anisotropy (i.e., seismic velocity varies with direction) and leads to measurable directional differences in traveltimes and reflectivity.
If the fractures are vertically aligned, they will produce azimuthal anisotropy (the simplest case being horizontal transverse isotropy, or HTI) such that reflectivity of an interface depends on azimuth as well as offset. If either of the media bounding the interface is azimuthally anisotropic, the AVO will have an azimuthal dependence . The P-P wave reflection coefficient have the following relation with the azimutal if anisotropy exist in the layers:
:&lt;math&gt;R_{PP}= A + (b_{11} \cos^2 \phi + 2b_{12} \cos\phi \sin\phi + b_{22} \sin^2 \phi)&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the azimuth from data acquisition grid, the terms &lt;math&gt;b_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are coefficients describing anisotropy parameter.

====Fractures- shear-wave splitting====
The behavior of shear waves as they pass through anisotropic media has been recognized for many years, with laboratory and field observations demonstrating how the shear wave splits into two polarized components with their planes aligned parallel and perpendicular to the anisotropy. For a fractured medium, the faster shear wave is generally aligned with the strike direction and the time delay between the split shear waves related to the fracture density and path length traveled. For layered medium, the shear wave polarized parallel to the layering arrives first.

==Examples of the application of anisotropy==
===Example of anisotropy in petroleum E&amp;P===
Two examples will be discussed in there to show the anisotropy application in Petroleum E&amp;P area. The first related to anisotropy parameter estimation via deviated well sonic logging tool. And the second example reflects the image quality improvement by PreStack Depth Migration technology.

===Example of deviated well sonic logging===
In this case, the sonic velocity in a deviated well is obtained by dipole sonic logging tool . The formation is mostly composed of shale. In order to use the TI model, several assumptions are made:
* Rock should be in normally pressured regime.
* Rock should have similar burial history.

Satisfying the above conditions, the following equation hold for a TI model:
:&lt;math&gt;V_{P}(\phi)= V_P(0)(1 + \delta \sin^2\phi \cos^2\phi + \epsilon \sin^4 \phi)&lt;/math&gt;
Where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the deviated angle of the well, and &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; are anisotropy parameter.

The following plot shows typical velocity distribution vs density in a deviated well. The color of each data point represents the frequency of this data point. The red color means a high frequency while the blue color represents a low frequency. The black line shows a typical velocity trend without the effect of anisotropy. Since the existence of anisotropy effect, the sound velocity is higher than the trend line.

From the well logging data, the velocity vs &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; plot can be drawn. On the basis of this plot, a no liner regression will give us an estimate of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. The following plot show the non-linear regression and its result.

Put the estimated &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; into the following equation, the correct &lt;math&gt;V_P(0)&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained.
:&lt;math&gt;V_P(0) = \frac{V_P(\phi)}{1 + \delta\sin^2\phi\cos^2\phi + \epsilon\sin^4\phi}&lt;/math&gt;
By doing the above correction calculation, the corrected &lt;math&gt;V_P(0)&lt;/math&gt; is plot vs density in the following plot. As be seen in the plot, most of the data point falls on the trend line. It validate the correctness of the estimate of anisotropy parameter.

===Example of prestack depth migration Imaging===
In this case, the operator conducted several seismic surveys on a gas field in the north sea over the period of 1993-1998 . The early survey does not take into anisotropy into account, while the later survey employs the PreStack Depth Migration imaging. This PSDM was done on a commercial seismic package developed by Total. The following two plots clearly reveal the resolution improvement of the PSDM method. The top plot is a convention 3D survey without anisotropy effect. The bottom plot used PSDM method. As can be seen in the bottom plot, more small structure features are revealed due to the reduce of error and improved resolution.

==Limitations of seismic anisotropy==
Seismic anisotropy relies on shear waves, shear waves carry rich information which can sometimes impede its utilization. Shear waves survey for anisotropy requires multi component (usually 3 component) geophones which are oriented at angles, these are more expensive than the widely used vertical oriented single component geophones. However, while expensive 3 component seismometers are much more powerful in their ability to collect valuable information about the Earth that vertical component seismometers simply cannot. While seismic waves do attenuate, large earthquakes (moment magnitude &gt; 5) have the ability to produce observable shear waves. The second law of thermodynamics ensures a higher attenuation of shear wave reflected energy, this tends to impede the utilization of shear wave information for smaller earthquakes.

== Crustal anisotropy ==
In the Earth's crust, anisotropy may be caused by preferentially aligned joints or microcracks, by layered bedding in sedimentary formations, or by highly foliated metamorphic rocks. Crustal anisotropy resulting from aligned cracks can be used to determine the state of stress in the crust, since in many cases, cracks are preferentially aligned with their flat faces oriented in the direction of minimum compressive stress. In active tectonic areas, such as near faults and volcanoes, anisotropy can be used to look for changes in preferred orientation of cracks that may indicate a rotation of the stress field.

Both seismic [[P-waves]] and [[S-waves]] may exhibit anisotropy. For both, the anisotropy may appear as a (continuous) dependence of velocity upon the direction of propagation. For S-waves, it may also appear as a (discrete) dependence of velocity upon the direction of polarization. For a given direction of propagation in any homogeneous medium, only two polarization directions are allowed, with other polarizations decomposing trigonometrically into these two. Hence, shear waves naturally "split" into separate arrivals with these two polarizations; in optics this is called [[birefringence]].

Crustal anisotropy is very important in the production of oil reservoirs, as the seismically fast directions can indicate preferred directions of fluid flow.

In crustal geophysics, the anisotropy is usually weak; this enables a simplification of the expressions for seismic velocities and reflectivities, as functions of propagation (and polarization) direction. In the simplest geophysically plausible case, that of [[linear elasticity#Anisotropic homogeneous media|polar anisotropy]], the analysis is most conveniently done in terms of [[Thomsen Parameters]].

== Mantle anisotropy ==
In the mantle, anisotropy is normally associated with crystals (mainly [[olivine]]) aligned with the mantle flow direction called lattice preferred orientation (LPO). Due to their elongate crystalline structure, olivine crystals tend to align with the flow due to [[mantle convection]] or small scale convection. Anisotropy has long been used to argue whether plate tectonics is driven from below by mantle convection or from above by the plates, i.e. slab pull and ridge push.

The favored methods for detecting seismic anisotropy are [[shear wave splitting]], [[seismic tomography]] of surface waves and body waves, and converted-wave scattering in the context of a [[receiver function]].  In shear-wave splitting, the S wave splits into two orthogonal polarizations, corresponding to the fastest and slowest wavespeeds in that medium for that propagation direction.  The period range for mantle splitting studies is typically 5-25-sec. In seismic tomography, one must have a spatial distribution of seismic sources (earthquakes or man-made blasts) to generate waves at multiple wave-propagation azimuths through a 3-D medium. For receiver functions, the P-to-S converted wave displays harmonic variation with earthquake back azimuth when the material at depth is anisotopic. This method allows determination of layers of anisotropic material at depth beneath a station.

In the transition zone, [[wadsleyite]] and/or [[Ringwoodite|ringwoodit]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;e could be aligned in LPO. Below the [[Transition zone (Earth)|transition zone,]] the three main minerals, [[periclase]], [[silicate perovskite]] ([[bridgmanite]]), and [[post-perovskite]] are all [[Anisotropy|anisotropic]] and could be generating anisotropy observed in the [[D"]] region (a couple hundred kilometer thick layer about the core-mantle boundary).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Long|first=Maureen D.|last2=Silver|first2=Paul G.|date=2009-06-27|title=Shear Wave Splitting and Mantle Anisotropy: Measurements, Interpretations, and New Directions|journal=Surveys in Geophysics|language=en|volume=30|issue=4–5|pages=407–61|doi=10.1007/s10712-009-9075-1|issn=0169-3298|bibcode=2009SGeo...30..407L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Geophysicists routinely perform [[Reflection seismology|seismic surveys]] to gather information about the [[geology]] of an [[Petroleum|oil]] or [[Natural gas|gas]] field. These surveys record sound waves which have traveled through the layers of rock and fluid in the earth. The [[amplitude]] and [[frequency]] of these waves can be estimated so that any side-lobe and tuning effects&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=tuning%20effect Oilfield glossary] Retrieved 2011-06-03.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced by the wavelet may be removed.

Seismic data may be inspected and interpreted on its own without inversion, but this does not provide the most detailed view of the subsurface and can be misleading under certain conditions. Because of its efficiency and quality, most oil and gas companies now use seismic inversion to increase the resolution and reliability of the data and to improve estimation of rock properties including [[porosity]] and net pay.&lt;ref&gt;Pendrel, J., "Seismic Inversion—A Critical Tool in Reservoir Characterization", Scandinavian Oil-Gas Magazine, No. 5/6, 2006, pp. 19–22
.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many different techniques used in seismic inversion.&lt;ref name=Sen&gt;Sen, M. K., "Seismic Inversion", Society of Petroleum Engineers, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; These can be roughly grouped into two categories:

# pre-stack or post-stack
# seismic resolution or well-log resolution

The combination of these categories yields four technical approaches to the inversion problem, and the selection of a specific technique depends on the desired objective and the characteristics of the subsurface rocks. Although the order presented reflects advances in inversion techniques over the past 20 years, each grouping still has valid uses in particular projects or as part of a larger workflow.

==Wavelet estimation==
All modern seismic inversion methods require seismic data and a [[wavelet]] estimated from the data. Typically, a [[reflection coefficient]] series from a well within the boundaries of the seismic survey is used to estimate the wavelet [[phase (waves)|phase]] and frequency. Accurate wavelet estimation is critical to the success of any seismic inversion. The inferred shape of the seismic wavelet may strongly influence the seismic inversion results and, thus, subsequent assessments of the reservoir quality.

Wavelet amplitude and [[Bandwidth-limited pulse|phase spectra]] are estimated [[statistics|statistically]] from either the seismic data alone or from a combination of seismic data and well control using wells with available [[Sonic logging|sonic]] and [[Density logging|density]] curves. After the seismic wavelet is estimated, it is used to estimate seismic reflection coefficients in the seismic inversion.

When the estimated (constant) phase of the statistical wavelet is consistent with the final result, the wavelet estimation converges more quickly than when starting with a [[Deconvolution|zero phase]] assumption. Minor edits and "stretch and squeeze" may be applied to the well to better align the events. Accurate wavelet estimation requires the accurate tie of the [[acoustic impedance|impedance]] log to the seismic. Errors in well tie can result in phase or frequency artifacts in the wavelet estimation. Once the wavelet is identified, seismic inversion computes a synthetic log for every seismic trace. To ensure quality, the inversion result is convolved with the wavelet to produce synthetic seismic traces which are compared to the original seismic.&lt;ref name=Sen/&gt;

==Components of inversion==
Inversion includes both seismic field data and well data, where well data serves to add the high frequency below the seismic band and to constrain the inversion. Well logs are first conditioned and edited to ensure there is a suitable relationship between impedance logs and the desired properties. The logs are then converted to time, filtered to approximate the seismic bandwidth and edited for borehole effects, balanced and classified by quality.

Seismic data is band-limited, reducing resolution and quality. To extend the frequency band available, low-frequency data is derived from log data, pre-stack depth or time migrated velocities and/or a regional gradient.&lt;ref&gt;Latimer, R., Davison, R., van Riel, P., "An Interpreter’s Guide to Understanding and Working with Seismic-Derived Acoustic Impedance Data", The Leading Edge, March 2000, pp. 242–256.&lt;/ref&gt; High frequency can be derived from well control or geostatistical analysis.

Initial inversions are often run with relaxed constraints, starting with the seismic and then adding limited-trend data from the wells. This provides a rough overview of the reservoir in an unbiased manner. It is critical at this point to evaluate the accuracy of the tie between the inversion results and the wells, and between the original seismic data and the derived synthetics. It is also important to ensure that the wavelet matches the phase and frequency of seismic data.

Without a wavelet, the solution is not unique. Deterministic inversions address this problem by constraining the answer in some way, usually to well log data. [[Stochastic]] inversions address this problem by generating a range of plausible solutions, which can then be narrowed through testing for best fit against various measurements (including production data).

==Post-stack seismic resolution inversion==

An example of a post-stack seismic resolution inversion technique is the Constrained Sparse-Spike Inversion (CSSI). This assumes a limited number of reflection coefficients, with larger amplitude. The inversion results in acoustic impedance (AI), which is the product of rock density and [[p-wave]] velocity. Unlike seismic reflection data (which is an interface property) AI is a rock property. The model generated is of higher quality, and does not suffer from tuning and [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] caused by the wavelet.

CSSI transforms seismic data to a pseudo-acoustic impedance log at every trace.  Acoustic impedance is used to produce more accurate and detailed structural and [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] interpretations than can be obtained from seismic (or [[seismic attribute]]) interpretation. In many geological environments acoustic impedance has a strong relationship to [[Reservoir petrophysics|petrophysical]] properties such as porosity, [[lithology]], and fluid saturation.

A good (CSSI) [[algorithm]] will produce four high-quality acoustic impedance volumes from full or post-stack seismic data: full-bandwidth impedance, [[bandlimited]] Impedance, reflectivity model, and low-frequency component. Each of these components can be inspected for its contribution to the solution and to check the results for quality. To further adapt the algorithm mathematics to the behavior of real rocks in the subsurface, some CSSI algorithms use a mixed-norm approach and allow a weighting factor between minimizing the sparsity of the solution and minimizing the misfit of the residual traces.

==Pre-stack seismic resolution inversion==

Pre-stack inversion is often used when post-stack inversion fails to sufficiently differentiate geologic features with similar P-impedance signatures.&lt;ref&gt;Pendrel, J., "Seismic Inversion—The Best Tool for Reservoir Characterization", CSEG Recorder.&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneous inversion solves for S-impedance and density, in addition to P-impedance. While many geologic features can express similar P-impedance characteristics, few will share combined P-impedance and S-impedance traits (allowing improved separation and clarity). Often a feasibility study using the wells logs will indicate whether separation of the desired lithotype can be achieved with P-impedance alone or whether S-impedance is also required.  This will dictate whether a pre- or post-stack inversion is needed.

Simultaneous Inversion (SI) is a pre-stack method that uses multiple offset or angle seismic sub-stacks and their associated wavelets as input; it generates P-impedance, S-impedance and [[density]] as outputs (although the density output resolution is rarely as high as the impedances). This helps improve discrimination between lithology, porosity and fluid effects. For each input partial stack, a unique wavelet is estimated. All models, partial stacks and wavelets are input to a single inversion algorithm —enabling inversion to effectively compensate for offset-dependent phase, bandwidth, tuning and [[Normal Move Out|NMO]] stretch effects.&lt;ref&gt;Pendrel, J., Dickson, T., "Simultaneous AVO Inversion to P Impedance and Vp/Vs", SEG.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inversion algorithm works by first estimating angle-dependent P-wave reflectivities for the input-partial stacks. Next, these are used with the full [[Zoeppritz equations]] (or approximations, such as Aki–Richards, for some algorithms) to find band-limited elastic reflectivities. These are in turn merged with their low-frequency counterparts from the model and integrated to [[Elastic modulus|elastic properties]]. This approximate result is then improved in a final inversion for P-impedance, S-impedance and density, subject to various hard and soft constraints. One constraint can control the relation between density and compressional velocity; this is necessary when the range of angles is not great enough to be diagnostic of density.

An important part in the inversion procedure is the estimation of the seismic wavelets. This is accomplished by computing a filter that best shapes the angle-dependent well log reflection coefficients in the region of interest to the corresponding offset stack at the well locations. Reflection coefficients are calculated from P-sonic, S-sonic and density logs using the [[Zoeppritz equations]]. The wavelets, with amplitudes representative of each offset stack, are input directly into the inversion algorithm. Since a different wavelet is computed for each offset volume, compensation is automatically done for offset-dependent bandwidth, scaling and tuning effects. A near-stack wavelet can be used as the starting point for estimating the far-angle (or offset) wavelet.

No prior knowledge of the elastic parameters and density beyond the solution space defined by any hard constraints is provided at the well locations. This makes comparison of the filtered well logs and the inversion outputs at these locations a natural quality control. The lowest frequencies from the inversion are replaced with information from the geologic model since they are poorly constrained by the seismic data. When applied in global mode a spatial control term is added to the objective function and large subsets of traces are inverted simultaneously. The simultaneous inversion algorithm takes multiple angle-stacked seismic data sets and generates three elastic parameter volumes as output.

The resulting elastic parameters are real-rock properties that can be directly related to reservoir properties. The more advanced algorithms use the full Knott–Zoeppritz equations and there is full allowance for amplitude and phase variations with offset. This is done by deriving unique wavelets for each input-partial stack. The elastic parameters themselves can be directly constrained during the seismic inversion and rock-physics relationships can be applied, constraining pairs of elastic parameters to each other. Final elastic-parameter models optimally reproduce the input seismic, as this is part of the seismic inversion optimization.

==Post stack geostatistical inversion==

Geostatistical inversion integrates high resolution well data with low resolution 3-D seismic, and provides a model with high vertical detail near and away from well control. This generates reservoir models with geologically-plausible shapes, and provides a clear quantification of [[uncertainty]] to assess risk. Highly detailed petrophysical models are generated, ready for input to reservoir-flow simulation.

[[Geostatistics]] differs from statistics in that it recognizes that only certain outcomes are geologically plausible. Geostatistical inversion integrates data from many sources and creates models that have greater resolution than the original seismic, match known geological patterns, and can be used for [[risk assessment]] and reduction.

Seismic, well logs and other input data are each represented as a [[probability density function]] (PDF), which provides a geostatistical description based on [[histogram]]s and [[variogram]]s. Together these define the chances of a particular value at a particular location, and the expected geological scale and composition throughout the modeled area.

Unlike conventional inversion and geomodeling algorithms, geostatistical inversion takes a one-step approach, solving for impedance and discrete property types or lithofacies at the same time. Taking this approach speeds the process and improves accuracy.

Individual PDFs are merged using [[bayesian inference]] techniques, resulting in a posterior PDF conditioned to the whole data set. The algorithm determines the weighting of each data source, eliminating potential bias. The posterior PDF is then input to a [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] algorithm to generate realistic models of impedance and lithofacies, which are then used to co-simulate rock properties such as porosity. These processes are typically iterated until a model emerges that matches all information. Even with the best model, some uncertainty remains. Uncertainty can be estimated using random seeds to generate a range of realizations. This is especially useful when dealing with parameters that are sensitive to change; an analysis of this sort enables greater understanding of development risk.

==Pre-stack log-detail inversion==
[[Amplitude versus offset]] (AVO) (AVA) geostatistical inversion incorporates simultaneous AVO (AVA) inversion into the geostatistical inversion algorithm so high resolution, geostatistics, and AVO may be attained in a single method. The output model ([[Realization (probability)|realizations]]) are consistent with well log information, AVO seismic data, and honor rock property relationships found in the wells. The algorithm also simultaneously produces elastic properties (P-impedance, S-impedance and density) and lithology volumes, instead of sequentially solving for lithology first and then populating the cell with impedance and density values. Because all output models match all input data, uncertainty can be quantitatively assessed to determine the range of reservoir possibilities within the constraining data.

AVA geostatistical inversion software uses leading-edge geostatistical techniques, including Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and pluri-Gaussian lithology modeling. It is thus possible to exploit "informational synergies" to retrieve details that deterministic inversion techniques blur out or omit. As a result, geoscientists are more successful in reconstructing both the overall structure and the fine details of the reservoir. The use of multiple-angle-stack seismic volumes in AVA geostatistical inversion enables further evaluation of elastic rock properties and probable lithology or seismic facies and fluid distributions with greater accuracy.

The process begins with a detailed petrophysical analysis and well log calibration.  The calibration process replaces unreliable and missing sonic and density measurements with synthesized values from calibrated petrophysical and rock-physics models.  Well log information is used in the inversion process to derive wavelets, supply the low frequency component not present in the seismic data, and to verify and analyze the final results. Next, horizon and log data are used to construct the stratigraphic framework for the statistical information to build the models. In this way, the log data is only used for generating statistics within similar rock types within the stratigraphic layers of the earth.

Wavelet analysis is conducted by extracting a filter from each of the seismic volumes using the well elastic (angle or offset) impedance as the desired output.  The quality of the inversion result is dependent upon the extracted seismic wavelets.  This requires accurate p-sonic, s-sonic and density logs tied to the appropriate events on the seismic data.  Wavelets are extracted individually for each well.  A final "multi-well" wavelet is then extracted for each volume using the best individual well ties and used as input to the inversion.

Histograms and variograms are generated for each stratigraphic layer and lithology, and preliminary simulations are run on small areas. The AVA geostatistical inversion is then run to generate the desired number of realizations, which match all the input data. The results are [[quality control]]led by direct comparison of the inverted rock property volumes against the well logs. Further QC involves review by a multidisciplinary team of all input parameters and the results of the simulation. Analysis of multiple realizations produces mean (P50) property cubes or maps. Most often these are lithology or seismic [[facies]] cubes and predicted lithology or facies [[Probability|probabilities]], but other outputs are also possible. Selected lithology and facies cubes are also generated for P15 and P85 probabilities (for example). Reservoir 3-D bodies of [[hydrocarbon]]-bearing units are captured with their corresponding rock properties, and the uncertainty in reservoir size and properties is quantified.

'''Shale gouge ratio''' (typically abbreviated to '''SGR''') is a mathematical [[algorithm]] that aims to predict the fault rock types for simple [[fault (geology)|fault]] zones developed in [[sedimentary]] sequences dominated by [[sandstone]]s and [[shale]]s.

The parameter is widely used in the [[Oil exploration|oil and gas exploration]] and [[petroleum industry|production industries]] to enable quantitative predictions to be made regarding the hydrodynamic behavior of faults.  

==Definition==
At any point on a fault surface, the shale gouge ratio is equal to the net shale/[[clay]] content of the rocks that have slipped past that point.  

The SGR algorithm assumes complete mixing of the wall-rock components in any particular 'throw interval'.  The parameter is a measure of the 'upscaled' composition of the fault zone.

==Application to hydrocarbon exploration==
[[Oil exploration|Hydrocarbon exploration]] involves identifying and defining accumulations of [[hydrocarbon]]s that are trapped in subsurface structures.  These structures are often segmented by faults.  For a thorough trap evaluation, it is necessary to predict whether the fault is sealing or leaking to hydrocarbons and also to provide an estimate of how 'strong' the fault seal might be.  The 'strength' of a fault seal can be quantified in terms of subsurface pressure, arising from the [[buoyancy]] forces within the hydrocarbon column, that the fault can support before it starts to leak.  When acting on a fault zone this subsurface pressure is termed [[capillary threshold pressure]].

For faults developed in sandstone and shale sequences, the first order control on capillary threshold pressure is likely to be the composition, in particular the shale or clay content, of the fault-zone material.  SGR is used to estimate the shale content of the fault zone.

In general, fault zones with higher clay content, equivalent to higher SGR values, can support higher capillary threshold pressures.  On a broader scale, other factors also exert a control on the threshold pressure, such as depth of the rock sequence at the time of faulting, and the maximum burial depth.  As maximum burial depth exceeds 3&amp;nbsp;km, the effective strength of the fault seal will increase for all fault zone compositions.

'''Slips''' is a device used to grip and hold the upper part of a [[drill string]] to the [[drill floor]] on an [[Drilling rig|oil rig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alcoinc.ca/products/drilling-service-rig-equipment/floor-equipment/manual-slips.aspx|title=Manual Slips {{!}} Alco Inc.|website=www.alcoinc.ca|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slips are constructed as a collection of metal wedges, hinged together to form a circular shape around the [[drill pipe]]. On the inside surface, the slips normally has replaceable steel teeth that grips the pipe. The outsides of the slips are [[tapered]] and meets a similar taper on the [[drill floor]]. Usually the pipe goes through a [[Rotary table (drilling rig)|Rotary table]] - machinery that makes the pipe rotate.

After the slips is placed around the [[drill pipe]], it is lowered so that the teeth on the inside grip the pipe and the slips are pulled down. The wedges then holds the drill pipe by the [[compressive force]].

After work is completed, the drill string is raised, thereby unlocking the [[gripping action]]. The slips are then lifted away.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6443">In [[petroleum geology]], '''source rock''' refers to rocks from which [[hydrocarbons]] have been generated or are capable of being generated. They form one of the necessary elements of a working [[petroleum system]]. They are organic-rich sediments that may have been deposited in a variety of [[Sedimentary depositional environment|environments]] including deep water [[Marine biology|marine]], [[Lake|lacustrine]] and [[River delta|deltaic]]. [[Oil shale]] can be regarded as an organic-rich but immature source rock from which little or no oil has been generated and expelled.&lt;ref name="Hyne"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=D4I-G0DcTcUC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=oil+shale+immature+source&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=oil%20shale%20immature%20source&amp;f=false |title=Nontechnical Guide to Petroleum Geology, Exploration, Drilling, and Production |last=Hyne N.J. |publisher=PennWell Books |year=2001 |isbn=9780878148233 |page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsurface source rock mapping methodologies make it possible to identify likely zones of petroleum occurrence in sedimentary basins as well as [[shale gas]] plays.

== Types of source rocks ==
Source rocks are classified from the types of [[kerogen]] that they contain, which in turn governs the type of hydrocarbons that will be generated.
* Type I source rocks are formed from algal remains deposited under [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] conditions in deep [[lake]]s: they tend to generate waxy crude oils when submitted to thermal stress during deep burial.
* Type II source rocks are formed from marine planktonic and bacterial remains  preserved under anoxic conditions in marine environments: they produce both oil and gas when thermally cracked during deep burial.
* Type III source rocks are formed from terrestrial plant material that has been decomposed by [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] under oxic or sub-oxic conditions: they tend to generate mostly gas with associated light oils when thermally cracked during deep burial. Most coals and coaly shales are generally Type 3 source rocks.

== Maturation and expulsion ==
With increasing burial by later sediments and increase in temperature, the kerogen within the rock begins to break down. This thermal degradation or [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] releases shorter chain hydrocarbons from the original large and complex [[molecules]] occurring in the kerogen.

The hydrocarbons generated from thermally mature source rock are first expelled, along with other pore fluids, due to the effects of internal source rock over-pressuring caused by hydrocarbon generation as well as by [[Compaction (geology)|compaction]]. Once released into porous and permeable [[carrier (disambiguation)|carrier]] beds or into faults planes, oil and gas then move upwards towards the surface in an overall buoyancy-driven process known as ''secondary migration''.

== Mapping source rocks in sedimentary basins ==
Areas underlain by thermally mature generative source rocks in a sedimentary basin are called ''generative basins or depressions'' or else ''hydrocarbon kitchens''. Mapping those regional oil and gas generative "hydrocarbon kitchens" is feasible by integrating the existing source rock data into seismic depth maps that structurally follow the source horizon(s). It has been statistically observed at a world scale &lt;ref&gt;Gerard Demaison: "The Generative Basin Concept" in: American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) Memoir #35 : "Petroleum Geochemistry and Basin Evaluation", 1984 , Edited by Gerard Demaison and Roelof J. Murris, {{ISBN|0-89181-312-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; that zones of high success ratios in finding oil and gas generally correlate in most basin types (such as intracratonic or rift basins) with the mapped "generative depressions". Cases of long distance oil migration into shallow traps away from the "generative depressions" are usually found in foreland basins.

Besides pointing to zones of high petroleum potential  within a sedimentary basin, subsurface mapping of a source rock's degree of thermal maturity is also the basic tool to identify and broadly delineate [[shale gas]] plays.

== World class source rocks ==
Certain source rocks are referred to as "world class", meaning that they are not only of very high quality but are also thick and of wide geographical distribution. Examples include:
* Middle Devonian to lower Mississippian widespread marine [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] oil and gas source beds in the [[Mid-Continent]] and [[Appalachia]] areas of North America: (e.g. the [[Bakken Formation]] of the [[Williston Basin]], the [[Antrim Shale]] of the [[Michigan Basin]], the [[Marcellus Shale]] of the [[Appalachian Basin]]).
* [[Kimmeridge Clay]] – This upper Jurassic marine [[mudstone]] or its stratigraphic equivalents generated most of the oil found in the [[North Sea]] and the [[Norwegian Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.usgs.gov/bul/2204/c/pdf/B2204C.pdf Kimmeridgian Shales Total Petroleum System of the North Sea Graben Province – USGS Bulletin]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5255">{{Well logging}}

'''Spontaneous potential log''', commonly called the '''[[spontaneous potential|self potential]] log''' or '''SP log''', is a passive measurement taken by [[oil industry]] [[well logging|well loggers]] to characterise rock formation properties.  The log works by measuring small electric potentials (measured in millivolts) between depths in the borehole and a grounded electrode at the surface. Conductive bore hole fluids are necessary to create a SP response, so the SP log cannot be used in nonconductive drilling muds (e.g. oil-based mud) or air filled holes.{{r|"Assaad2008"}}

The change in voltage through the well bore is caused by a buildup of charge on the well bore walls.  Clays and shales (which are composed predominantly of clays) will generate one charge and permeable formations such as sandstone will generate an opposite one.  Spontaneous potentials occur when two aqueous solutions with different ionic concentrations are placed in contact through a porous, semi-permeable membrane. In nature, ions tend to migrate from high to low ionic concentrations. In the case of SP logging, the two aqueous solutions are the well bore fluid ([[drilling mud]]) and the formation water ([[connate water]]). The potential opposite shales is called the baseline, and typically shifts only slowly over the depth of the borehole.

The relative salinity of the mud and the formation water will determine the which way the SP curve will deflect opposite a permeable formation. Generally if the ionic concentration of the well bore fluid is less than the formation fluid then the SP reading will be more negative (usually plotted as a deflection to the left). If the formation fluid has an ionic concentration less than the well bore fluid, the voltage deflection will be positive (usually plotted as an excursion to the right). The amplitudes of the line made by the changing SP will vary from formation to formation and will not give a definitive answer to how permeable or the porosity of the formation that it is logging.

The presence of hydrocarbons (e.g. oil, natural gas, condensate) will reduce the response on an SP log because the interstitial water contact with the well bore fluid is reduced. This phenomenon is called hydrocarbon suppression and can be used to diagnose rocks for commercial potential. The SP curve is usually 'flat' opposite shale formations because there is no ion exchange due to the low permeability, low porosity properties (tight)thus creating a baseline. Tight rocks other than shale (e.g. tight sandstones, tight carbonates) will also result in poor or no response on the SP curve because of no ion exchange.

The SP tool is one of the simplest tools and is generally run as standard when logging a hole, along with the [[Gamma ray logging|gamma ray]]. SP data can be used to find:

*Depths of permeable formations
*The boundaries of these formations
*Correlation of formations when compared with data from other analogue wells
*Values for the formation-water resistivity

The SP curve can be influenced by various factors both in the formation and introduced into the wellbore by the drilling process.  These factors can cause the SP curve to be muted or even inverted depending on the situation.

*Formation bed thickness
*Resistivities in the formation bed and the adjacent formations
*Resistivity and make up  of the drilling mud
*Wellbore diameter
*The depth of invasion by the drilling mud into the formation

Mud invasion into the permeable formation can cause the deflections in the SP curve to be rounded off and to reduce the amplitude of thin beds.{{r|"Drilling1997"}}

A smaller wellbore will cause, like a mud filtrate invasion, the deflections on the SP curve to be rounded off and decrease the amplitude opposite thin beds, while a larger diameter wellbore has the opposite effect.
If the salinity of the mud filtrate is greater than formation water the SP currents will flow in opposite direction. In that case SP deflection will be positive towards to the right. Positive deflections are observed for fresh water bearing formations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3683">In [[petroleum geology]], a '''structural trap''' is a type of geological trap that forms as a result of changes in the structure of the subsurface, due to [[fault (geology)|tectonic]], [[salt tectonics|diapiric]], gravitational and [[fold (geology)|compactional]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/Terms.aspx?LookIn=term%2520name&amp;filter=structural+trap|title=Search Results - Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary|website=www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com|accessdate=August 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gluyas, J. &amp; Swarbrick, R. (2004) Petroleum Geoscience. Publ. Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;  These changes block the upward migration of [[hydrocarbon]]s and can lead to the formation of a [[petroleum reservoir]].  

Structural traps are the most important type of trap as they represent the majority of the world's discovered petroleum resources.&lt;ref&gt;Allen P.A. &amp; Allen J.R. (1990) Basin Analysis. pp 373. Publ. Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;  The three basic forms of structural traps are the anticline trap, the fault trap and the salt dome trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.priweb.org/ed/pgws/systems/traps/structural/structural.html|title=Petroleum Research Institution|accessdate=August 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anticlinal trap==
[[File:Anticline trap.svg|lang=en|thumb|Anticlinal trap]]
An [[anticline]] is an area of the subsurface where the strata have been pushed into forming a domed shape. If there is a layer of [[Permeability (earth sciences)|impermeable]] rock present in this dome shape, then hydrocarbons can accumulate at the crest until the anticline is filled to the ''spill point'' - the highest point where hydrocarbons can escape the anticline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Sheriff, R. E., Geldart, L. P. | year=1995 | title=Exploration Seismology |edition=2nd | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=0-521-46826-4 |page= 351}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This type of trap is by far the most significant to the hydrocarbon industry.  Anticline traps are usually long oval domes of land that can often be seen by looking at a geological map or by flying over the land.

==Fault trap==
[[File:Fault line.svg|lang=en|thumb|Fault trap]]
This trap is formed by the movement of [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeable]] and impermeable layers of rock along a fault line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/Terms.aspx?LookIn=term%2520name&amp;filter=fault+trap|title=Search Results - Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary|website=www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com|accessdate=August 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The permeable reservoir rock faults such that it is now adjacent to an impermeable rock, preventing hydrocarbons from further migration.  In some cases, there can be an impermeable substance smeared along the fault line (such as clay) that also acts to prevent migration.  This is known as [[clay smear]].

==Salt dome trap==
[[File:Salt dome trap.svg|lang=en|thumb|Salt dome trap]]
Masses of salt are pushed up through clastic rocks due to their greater buoyancy, eventually breaking through and rising towards the surface (see [[salt dome]]).  This salt is impermeable and when it crosses a layer of permeable rock, in which hydrocarbons are migrating, it blocks the pathway in much the same manner as a fault trap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.priweb.org/ed/pgws/systems/traps/structural/structural.html|title=Petroleum Research Institute|accessdate=August 2, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is one of the reasons why there is significant focus on subsalt [[Reflection seismology|imaging]], despite the many technical challenges that accompany it.

'''Subsea Production Systems''' are typical wells located on the [[seabed]], shallow or deep water. Generally termed as Floating production system, where the [[petroleum]] is extracted at the seabed and the same can be tied back to an already existing production platform or an onshore facility. The [[oil platform]] well is drilled by a [[Offshore drilling|movable rig]] and the extracted [[oil]] or [[natural gas]] is transported by [[submarine pipeline]] under the sea and then to rise to a processing facility. 
It is classified into&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standard.no/pagefiles/1012/u-001r2.pdf NORSOK STANDARD, SUBSEA PRODUCTION SYSTEMS, June 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3145">The term '''swell filter''' in high resolution seismics ([[reflection seismology]]) or sub bottom profiling refers to the static correction that restores the coherence of a high resolution seismic profile.  The coherence of the image got lost because of the relative movement (a function of the wavelength of the signal and the [[Swell (wavelength)|swell]]) of the source and receiver during the recording.  In normal seismic recordings, the term '''swell filter''' refers to filtering the acoustic noise, created by waves, out of the seismic recording.

==High resolution seismics and subbottom profiling==

Very high resolution seismics ([[reflection seismology]]) is applied to make detailed acoustic profiles of a sea floor or lake floor.  Acoustic sources used include: air gun, water gun, sleeve gun, sparker and boomer.  The frequency used in this field ranges from 100 Hz to 10.000 Hz.

Subbottom profiling is a technique used in [[acoustical oceanography]].  [[Sonars]] or [[echo sounder]] are typical sources for very high resolution imaging. Also used in this field are parametric echosounders.  The main difference with the high resolution seismics is the type of source used.

==Problematic swell==

When the movement of the platform and equipment due to swell is too heavy during a seismic recording, the coherence of the image gets lost.  The reason why it gets lost is because the movement of source and receiver is larger than the wavelength of the signal produced by the source.  As such the seismic reflectors do not line up.

[[Image:True vertical depth.jpg|thumb|250 px|right|(a) is an imaginary line representing the true vertical depth, while line (b) is the [[borehole]] itself, and its length is called the measured depth.]]

'''True vertical depth'''[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=true%20vertical%20depth] is the measurement of a straight line [[perpendicular]]ly downwards from a [[horizontal plane]].

In the [[petroleum industry]], true vertical depth, abbreviated as TVD, is the measurement from the surface to the bottom of the [[borehole]] (or anywhere along its length) in a straight perpendicular line represented by line (a) in the image.

Line (b) is the actual borehole and its length would be considered the "measured depth"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Terms/m/measured_depth.aspx|title=measured depth - Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary|website=www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com|access-date=2019-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[oil industry]] terminology. The TVD is ''always'' equal to or less than (≤) the ''measured depth''. If you imagine line (b) were a piece of string and pull it straight down, you would see that it would be longer than line (a). This example [[oilwell]] would be considered a [[directional well]] because it deviates from a straight vertical line.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1865">'''Water contact''' is a term used in the [[hydrocarbon]] industry to describe the elevation above which fluids other than water can be found in the [[porosity|pore]]s of a rock.  

For example, in a traditional hand-excavated [[water well]], the level at which the water stabilizes represents the water table, or the elevation in the rock where air starts to occupy the rock pores.

In most situations in the hydrocarbon industry the term is qualified as being an oil-water contact (abbreviated to "OWC") or a gas-water contact ("GWC"). Often there is also a gas-oil contact ("GOC").

In an oil or gas [[Oil field|field]], hydrocarbons migrate into rocks and can be trapped if there is a [[Permeability (fluid)|permeability]] barrier to prevent upward escape.  Gas and oil are lighter than water, so they will form a bubble at the high end of the "trap" formed by the impermeable barriers.  A simple physical model of this would be a coffee cup held upside down underwater with an air bubble occupying the highest portion of the cup's interior.  The base of the bubble is the water contact.

[[Capillary action]] can obscure the true water contact in permeable media like [[sandstone]].  [[Capillary pressure]] prevents the hydrocarbons from expelling all of the water in the pores, which creates a transition zone between the fully saturated hydrocarbon levels and the fully saturated water levels.

In poorly porous intervals, the oil-water, gas-water or gas-oil contacts can similarly be obscured, which makes estimation of [[hydrocarbon reserves]] difficult. Descriptions of the well's petrophysics will then often further qualify to delineate a gas-down-to, oil-up-to, oil-down-to and water-up-to line, clearly showing the uncertainties involved.

'''Well logging''', also known as '''borehole logging''' is the practice of making a detailed record (a ''well log'') of the [[Formation (stratigraphy)|geologic formations]] penetrated by a [[borehole]].  The log may be based either on visual inspection of samples brought to the surface (''geological'' logs) or on physical measurements made by instruments lowered into the hole (''geophysical'' logs).  Some types of geophysical well logs can be done during any phase of a well's history: drilling, completing, producing, or abandoning. Well logging is performed in boreholes drilled for the [[hydrocarbon exploration|oil and gas]], [[groundwater]], [[Mineral exploration|mineral]] and [[Geothermal exploration|geothermal]] exploration, as well as part of environmental and [[geotechnical]] studies.

==Wireline logging==

[[File:Loggrdenres.jpg|thumb|Wireline log consisting of caliper, density and resistivity logs]]
[[File:LI1LOG.jpg|thumb|Wireline log consisting of a complete set of logs]]
The [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[Natural Gas|gas]] industry uses [[Wireline (cabling)|wireline]] logging to obtain a continuous record of a formation's [[petrophysics|rock properties]].  Wireline logging can be defined as being "The acquisition and analysis of geophysical data performed as a function of well bore depth, together with the provision of related services." Note that "wireline logging" and "mud logging" are not the same, yet are closely linked through the integration of the data sets. The measurements are made referenced to "TAH" - True Along Hole depth: these and the associated analysis can then be used to infer further properties, such as [[water content|hydrocarbon saturation]] and [[well control|formation pressure]], and to make further [[Drilling engineering|drilling]] and [[hydrocarbon exploration|production]] decisions.

Wireline logging is performed by lowering a 'logging tool' - or a string of one or more instruments - on the end of a wireline into an [[oil well]] (or borehole) and recording petrophysical properties using a variety of sensors.  Logging tools developed over the years measure the natural gamma ray, electrical, acoustic, stimulated radioactive responses, electromagnetic, nuclear magnetic resonance, pressure and other properties of the rocks and their contained fluids.  For this article, they are broadly broken down by the main property that they respond to.

The data itself is recorded either at surface (real-time mode), or in the hole (memory mode) to an electronic data format and then either a printed record or electronic presentation called a "well log" is provided to the client, along with an electronic copy of the raw data.  Well logging operations can either be performed during the drilling process (see Logging While Drilling), to provide real-time information about the formations being penetrated by the borehole, or once the well has reached Total Depth and the whole depth of the borehole can be logged.

Real-time data is recorded directly against measured cable depth.  Memory data is recorded against time, and then depth data is simultaneously measured against time.  The two data sets are then merged using the common time base to create an instrument response versus depth log.  Memory recorded depth can also be corrected in exactly the same way as real-time corrections are made, so there should be no difference in the attainable TAH accuracy.

The measured cable depth can be derived from a number of different measurements, but is usually either recorded based on a calibrated wheel counter, or (more accurately) using magnetic marks which provide calibrated increments of cable length.  The measurements made must then be corrected for elastic stretch and temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Harald Bolt, Wireline Depth Determination, Rev 3.3, Apr 2012, available via Society of Professional Well Log Analysts web site, www.spwla.org&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many types of wireline logs and they can be categorized either by their function or by the technology that they use. "Open hole logs" are run before the oil or gas well is lined with pipe or cased. "Cased hole logs" are run after the well is lined with casing or production pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Wireline logs can be divided into broad categories based on the physical properties measured.

===History===
[[Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger]], who founded [[Schlumberger|Schlumberger Limited]] in 1926, are considered the inventors of electric well logging.  Conrad developed the [[Schlumberger array]], which was a technique for prospecting for [[metal]] [[ore]] deposits, and the brothers adapted that surface technique to subsurface applications.  On September 5, 1927, a crew working for Schlumberger lowered an electric sonde or tool down a well in Pechelbronn, Alsace, France creating the first [[well log]].  In modern terms, the first log was a [[resistivity log]] that could be described as 3.5-meter upside-down lateral log.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1931, [[Henri George Doll]] and G. Dechatre, working for Schlumberger, discovered that the [[galvanometer]] wiggled even when no current was being passed through the logging cables down in  the well.  This led to the discovery of the [[spontaneous potential]] (SP) which was as important as the ability to measure [[resistivity]].  The SP effect was produced naturally by the borehole [[mud]] at the boundaries of [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeable]] beds.  By simultaneously recording SP and resistivity, loggers could distinguish between permeable oil-bearing beds and impermeable nonproducing beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pike |first=Bill |authorlink= |author2=Rhonda Duey |title=Logging history rich with innovation |journal=Hart's E&amp;P |volume= |issue= |pages=52–55 |publisher= |location= |year=2002 |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7442038_ITM |doi= |id= |accessdate=2008-06-02 |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3APike+intitle%3ALogging+history+rich+with+innovation&amp;as_publication=Hart%27s+E%26P&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, Schlumberger invented the [[spontaneous potential]] [[dipmeter]]; this instrument allowed the calculation of the [[strike and dip|dip]] and direction of the dip of a layer.  The basic dipmeter was later enhanced by the resistivity dipmeter (1947) and the continuous resistivity dipmeter (1952).

Oil-based mud (OBM) was first used in Rangely Field, Colorado in 1948.  Normal electric logs require a conductive or water-based mud, but OBMs are nonconductive.  The solution to this problem was the induction log, developed in the late 1940s.

The introduction of the [[transistor]] and [[integrated circuits]] in the 1960s made electric logs vastly more reliable.  Computerization allowed much faster log processing, and dramatically expanded log data-gathering capacity.  The 1970s brought more logs and computers.  These included combo type logs where [[resistivity logs]] and porosity logs were recorded in one pass in the borehole.

The two types of porosity logs (acoustic logs and nuclear logs) date originally from the 1940s.  [[Sonic logs]] grew out of technology developed during World War II.  Nuclear logging has supplemented acoustic logging, but acoustic or sonic logs are still run on some combination logging tools.

Nuclear logging was initially developed to measure the natural gamma radiation emitted by underground formations.   However, the industry quickly moved to logs that actively bombard rocks with [[nuclear particles]].  The [[gamma ray]] log, measuring the natural radioactivity, was introduced by Well Surveys Inc. in 1939, and the WSI [[neutron]] log came in 1941. The gamma ray log is particularly useful as shale beds which often provide a relatively low permeability cap over hydrocarbon reservoirs usually display a higher level of gamma radiation. These logs were important because they can be used in cased wells (wells with production casing).  WSI quickly became part of Lane-Wells.  During [[World War II]], the US Government gave a near wartime monopoly on open-hole logging to [[Schlumberger]], and a monopoly on cased-hole logging to [[Lane-Wells]].&lt;ref&gt;Now a division of Baker Hughes&lt;/ref&gt;  Nuclear logs continued to evolve after the war.

After the discovery of nuclear magnetic resonance by Bloch and Purcell in 1946, the [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] log using the Earth's field was developed in the early 1950s by Chevron and Schlumberger.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}  The NMR log was a scientific success but an engineering failure. More recent engineering developments by NUMAR (a subsidiary of [[Halliburton]]) in the 1990s has resulted in continuous NMR logging technology which is now applied in the oil and gas, water and metal exploration industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kleinberg|first1=Robert L.|last2=Jackson|first2=Jasper A.|title=An introduction to the history of NMR well logging|journal=Concepts in Magnetic Resonance|date=2001|volume=13|issue=6|pages=340–342|doi=10.1002/cmr.1018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Many modern oil and gas wells are drilled directionally.  At first, loggers had to run their tools somehow attached to the drill pipe if the well was not vertical.  Modern techniques now permit continuous information at the surface.  This is known as [[logging while drilling]] (LWD) or [[measurement-while-drilling]] (MWD).  MWD logs use [[mud pulse technology]] to transmit data from the tools on the bottom of the [[Drill string|drillstring]] to the processors at the surface.

===Electrical logs===

====Resistivity log====
{{See also|Resistivity logging}}
Resistivity logging measures the subsurface electrical resistivity, which is the ability to impede the flow of electric current. This helps to differentiate between formations filled with salty waters (good conductors of electricity) and those filled with hydrocarbons (poor conductors of electricity). Resistivity and porosity measurements are used to calculate water saturation. Resistivity is expressed in ohms or ohms/meter, and is frequently charted on a logarithm scale versus depth because of the large range of resistivity. The distance from the borehole penetrated by the current varies with the tool, from a few centimeters to one meter.

====[[Borehole Image Logs|Borehole Imaging]]====
{{Main|Borehole Image Logs}}

The term "borehole imaging" refers to those logging and data-processing methods that are used to produce centimeter-scale images of the borehole wall and the rocks that make it up. The context is, therefore, that of open hole, but some of the tools are closely related to their cased-hole equivalents. Borehole imaging has been one of the most rapidly advancing technologies in wireline well logging. The applications range from detailed reservoir description through reservoir performance to enhanced hydrocarbon recovery. Specific applications are fracture identification &lt;ref&gt; Taherdangkoo, R., &amp; Abdideh, M. (2016). Application of wavelet transform to detect fractured zones using conventional well logs data (Case study: Southwest of Iran). International Journal of Petroleum Engineering, 2(2), 125-139.&lt;/ref&gt;, analysis of small-scale sedimentological features, evaluation of net pay in thinly bedded formations, and the identification of breakouts (irregularities in the borehole wall that are aligned with the minimum horizontal stress and appear where stresses around the wellbore exceed the compressive strength of the rock).&lt;ref&gt;http://petrowiki.org/Borehole_imaging&lt;/ref&gt;
The subject area can be classified into four parts:
# Optical imaging
# Acoustic imaging
# Electrical imaging
# Methods that draw on both acoustic and electrical imaging techniques using the same logging tool

===Porosity logs===
[[Porosity]] logs measure the fraction or percentage of pore volume in a volume of rock. Most porosity logs use either [[acoustics|acoustic]] or [[Nuclear physics|nuclear]] technology.  Acoustic logs measure characteristics of sound waves propagated through the well-bore environment. Nuclear logs utilize nuclear reactions that take place in the downhole logging instrument or in the formation. Nuclear logs include density logs and neutron logs, as well as gamma ray logs which are used for correlation.

Since there is little difference in the neutrons scattered by hydrocarbons or water, the porosity measured gives a figure close to the true physical porosity whereas the figure obtained from electrical resistivity measurements is that due to the conductive formation fluid. The difference between neutron porosity and electrical porosity measurements therefore indicates the presence of hydrocarbons in the formation fluid.

====Density====
{{See also|Density logging}}
The density log measures the [[bulk density]] of a formation by bombarding it with a radioactive source and measuring the resulting gamma ray count after the effects of [[Compton Scattering]] and [[Photoelectric effect|Photoelectric absorption]].  This bulk density can then be used to determine porosity.

====Neutron porosity====
{{See also|Formation evaluation neutron porosity}}
The neutron porosity log works by bombarding a formation with high energy [[Neutron temperature|epithermal neutrons]] that lose energy through [[elastic scattering]] to near thermal levels before being absorbed by the [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of the formation atoms.  Depending on the particular type of neutron logging tool, either the [[gamma ray]] of capture, scattered thermal neutrons or scattered, higher energy epithermal neutrons are detected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=epithermal%20neutron%20porosity%20measurement Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;  The neutron porosity log is predominantly sensitive to the quantity of [[hydrogen atom]]s in a particular formation, which generally corresponds to rock porosity.

[[Boron]] is known to cause anomalously low neutron tool count rates due to it having a high capture cross section for thermal neutron absorption.&lt;ref&gt;

====Sonic====
{{See also|Sonic logging}}
A sonic log provides a formation interval transit time, which typically a function of lithology and rock texture but particularly porosity.  The logging tool consists of a piezoelectric transmitter and receiver and the time taken to for the sound wave to travel the fixed distance between the two is recorded as an ''interval transit time''.

===Lithology logs===

====Gamma ray====
{{See also|Gamma ray logging}}
A log of the natural radioactivity of the formation along the borehole, measured in [[American Petroleum Institute#Standards and certification|API units]], particularly useful for distinguishing between sands and shales in a siliclastic environment.&lt;ref name="darling"&gt;

In some rocks, and in particular in carbonate rocks, the contribution from uranium can be large and erratic, and can cause the carbonate to be mistaken for a shale. In this case, The carbonate gamma ray is a better indicator of shaliness. the carbonate gamma ray log is a gamma ray log from which the uranium contribution has been subtracted.

====Self/spontaneous potential====
{{See also|Spontaneous potential logging}}
The Spontaneous Potential (SP) log measures the natural or [[Spontaneous potential|spontaneous potential difference]] between the borehole and the surface, without any applied current.  It was one of the first wireline logs to be developed, found when a single potential [[electrode]] was lowered into a well and a potential was measured relative to a fixed reference electrode at the surface.&lt;ref name="Etnyre"&gt;

The most useful component of this potential difference is the [[electrochemical potential]] because it can cause a significant deflection in the SP response opposite permeable beds.  The magnitude of this deflection depends mainly on the [[salinity]] contrast between the drilling mud and the formation water, and the clay content of the permeable bed.  Therefore, the SP log is commonly used to detect permeable beds and to estimate clay content and formation water salinity.
The SP log can be used to distinguish between impermeable shale and permeable shale and  porous sands.

===Miscellaneous===

====Caliper====
{{See also|Caliper log}}
A tool that measures the diameter of the borehole, using either 2 or 4 arms.&lt;ref name="darling" /&gt;  It can be used to detect regions where the borehole walls are compromised and the well logs may be less reliable.

====Nuclear magnetic resonance====
{{See also|Nuclear magnetic resonance logging}}
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging uses the [[nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR response]] of a [[Formation (stratigraphy)|formation]] to directly determine its [[porosity]] and [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]], providing a continuous record along the length of the [[borehole]].&lt;ref&gt;Gluyas, J. &amp; Swarbrick, R. (2004) Petroleum Geoscience. Publ. Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleinberg"&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging – Technology of the 21st century.  Kenyon, Kleinberg, Straley, Gubelin, and Morris. Oilfield Review. http://eps.mcgill.ca/~courses/c550/Literature/NMR-21st-century.pdf{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The chief application of the NMR tool is to determine moveable fluid volume (BVM) of a rock. This is the pore space excluding clay bound water (CBW) and irreducible water (BVI). Neither of these are moveable in the NMR sense, so these volumes are not easily observed on older logs. On modern tools, both CBW and BVI can often be seen in the signal response after transforming the relaxation curve to the porosity domain. Note that some of the moveable fluids (BVM) in the NMR sense are not actually moveable in the oilfield sense of the word. Residual oil and gas, heavy oil, and bitumen may appear moveable to the NMR precession measurement, but these will not necessarily flow into a well bore.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.spec2000.net/07-nmrlog.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spectral noise logging====
'''Spectral noise logging (SNL)''' is an [[acoustic noise]] measuring technique used in [[oil well|oil]] and [[gas well]]s for well integrity analysis, identification of production and injection intervals and hydrodynamic characterisation of the reservoir. SNL records acoustic noise generated by fluid or gas flow through the reservoir or leaks in downhole well components.

Noise logging tools have been used in the [[petroleum industry]] for several decades. As far back as 1955, an acoustic detector was proposed for use in well integrity analysis to identify casing holes.&lt;ref&gt;Enright, R.J. 1955. Sleuth for Down-Hole Leaks, Oil &amp; Gas J.:78-79&lt;/ref&gt;
Over many years, downhole noise logging tools proved effective in inflow and injectivity profiling of operating wells,&lt;ref&gt;Britt E.L. 1976.

=== Logging while drilling ===

In the 1970s, a new approach to wireline logging was introduced in the form of [[Logging While Drilling|logging while drilling (LWD)]].  This technique provides similar well information to conventional wireline logging but instead of sensors being lowered into the well at the end of wireline cable, the sensors are integrated into the [[drill string]] and the measurements are made in real-time, whilst the well is being drilled.  This allows drilling engineers and geologists to quickly obtain information such as porosity, resistivity, hole direction and weight-on-bit and they can use this information to make immediate decisions about the future of the well and the direction of drilling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigzone.com/training/insight.asp?insight_id=297&amp;c_id=1 Rigzone How Does Logging-While-Drilling (LWD) Work?]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In LWD, measured data is transmitted to the surface in real time via pressure pulses in the well's mud fluid column.  This mud telemetry method provides a bandwidth of less than 10 bits per second, although, as drilling through rock is a fairly slow process, data compression techniques mean that this is an ample bandwidth for real-time delivery of information.  A higher sample rate of data is recorded into memory and retrieved when the drillstring is withdrawn at bit changes.  High-definition downhole and subsurface information is available through [[IntelliServ#Technology|networked or wired drillpipe]] that deliver memory quality data in real time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ali|first=T.H. |author2=M. Sas |author3=J.H. Hood |author4=S.R. Lemke |author5=A. Srinivasan|title=High Speed Telemetry Drill Pipe Network Optimizes Drilling Dynamics And Wellbore Placement|journal=Society of Petroleum Engineers|year=2008|url=http://www.onepetro.org/mslib/app/Preview.do?paperNumber=SPE-112636-MS&amp;societyCode=SPE|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corrosion well logging===
Throughout the life of the wells, integrity controles of the steel and cemented column (casing and tubing) are performed using calipers and thickness gauges. These advanced technical methods use non destructive technologies as ultrasonic, electromagnetic and magnetic transducers.&lt;ref&gt;Stéphane Sainson, ''Les diagraphies de corrosion''. Ed. Lavoisier, 548 p., 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memory log===
This method of data acquisition involves recording the sensor data into a down hole memory, rather than transmitting "Real Time" to surface. There are some advantages and disadvantages to this memory option.
*The tools can be conveyed into wells where the trajectory is deviated or extended beyond the reach of conventional Electric Wireline cables. This can involve a combination of weight to strength ratio of the electric cable over this extended reach. In such cases the memory tools can be conveyed on Pipe or Coil Tubing.
*The type of sensors are limited in comparison to those used on Electric Line, and tend to be focussed on the cased hole,production stage of the well. Although there are now developed some memory "Open Hole" compact formation evaluation tool combinations.  These tools can be deployed and carried downhole concealed internally in drill pipe to protect them from damage while running in the hole, and then "Pumped" out the end at depth to initiate logging. Other basic open hole formation evaluation memory tools are available for use in "Commodity" markets on slickline to reduce costs and operating time.
*In cased hole operation there is normally a "Slick Line" intervention unit. This uses a solid mechanical wire (0.072 - 0.125&amp;nbsp;inches in OD), to manipulate or otherwise carry out operations in the well bore completion system. Memory operations are often carried out on this Slickline conveyance in preference to mobilizing a full service Electric Wireline unit.
*Since the results are not known until returned to surface, any realtime well dynamic changes cannot be monitored real time. This limits the ability to modify or change the well down hole production conditions accurately during the memory logging by changing the surface production rates. Something that is often done in Electric Line operations.
*Failure during recording is not known until the memory tools are retrieved. This loss of data can be a major issue on large offshore (expensive) locations. On land locations (e.g. South Texas, US) where there is what is called a "Commodity" Oil service sector, where logging often is without the rig infrastructure. this is less problematic, and logs are often run again without issue.

==Coring==
{{See also|Core sample}}
[[File:Rochovce granite01.JPG|thumb|An example of a granite core]]
Coring is the process of obtaining an actual sample of a rock formation from the borehole.  There are two main types of coring: 'full coring', in which a sample of rock is obtained using a specialised drill-bit as the borehole is first penetrating the formation and 'sidewall coring', in which multiple samples are obtained from the side of the borehole after it has penetrated through a formation.  The main advantage of sidewall coring over full coring are that it is cheaper (drilling doesn't have to be stopped) and multiple samples can be easily acquired, with the main disadvantages being that there can be uncertainty in the depth at which the sample was acquired and the tool can fail to acquire the sample.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halliburton.com/ps/default.aspx?navid=1831&amp;pageid=1141&amp;prodgrpid=PRG%3a%3aJCFUH1E8Z Halliburton.

==Mudlogging==
{{See also|Mud logging}}
''[[Mud log]]s'' are well logs prepared by describing rock or soil cuttings brought to the surface by mud circulating in the borehole. In the oil industry they are usually prepared by a [[mud logging]] company contracted by the operating company. One parameter a typical mud log displays is the formation gas (gas units or ppm).  "The gas recorder usually is scaled in terms of arbitrary gas units, which are defined differently by the various gas-detector manufactures. In practice, significance is placed only on relative changes in the gas concentrations detected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Other information that is normally notated on a [[mud log]] include directional data ([[deviation surveys]]), [[weight on bit]], [[rotary table (drilling rig)|rotary speed]], [[pump pressure]], [[pump rate]], [[viscosity]], drill bit info, casing shoe depths, formation tops, mud pump info, to name just a few.

==Information use==
{{See also|Formation evaluation}}
In the oil industry, the well and mud logs are usually transferred in 'real time' to the operating company, which uses these logs to make operational decisions about the well, to correlate formation depths with surrounding wells, and to make interpretations about the quantity and quality of hydrocarbons present. Specialists involved in well log interpretation are called log analysts.

[[File:Command Fishing Services 2014-05-18 23-29.jpg|thumbnail|Wireline truck rigged up to a drilling rig in Canada]]

In the [[petroleum industry|oil and gas industry]], the term '''wireline''' usually refers to a [[cabling]] technology used by operators of [[Oil well|oil and gas wells]] to lower equipment or measurement devices into the well for the purposes of [[well intervention]], reservoir evaluation, and [[pipe recovery operations|pipe recovery.]]

Tools inserted into the well for both [[workover]] and logging efforts, wirelines and [[slickline|slicklines]] are very similar devices. While a slickline is a thin cable introduced into a well to deliver and retrieve tools downhole, a wireline is an electrical cable used to lower tools into and transmit data about the conditions of the wellbore called wireline logs. Usually consisting of braided cables, wirelines are used to perform wireline logging, as well.

Braided line can contain an inner core of insulated wires which provide power to equipment located at the end of the cable, normally referred to as electric line, and provides a pathway for electrical [[telemetry]] for communication between the surface and equipment at the end of the cable.

==Slicklines==
[[File:Pipe Recovery Wireline Truck.jpg|320x240px|right|thumb|Wireline truck]]

Used to place and recover wellbore equipment, such as plugs, gauges and valves, slicklines are single-strand non-electric cables lowered into oil and gas wells from the surface. Slicklines can also be used to adjust valves and sleeves located downhole, as well as repair tubing within the wellbore.

Wrapped around a drum on the back of a truck, the slickline is raised and lowered in the well by reeling in and out the wire hydraulically.

Braided line can contain an inner core of insulated wires which provide power to equipment located at the end of the cable, normally referred to as electric line, and provides a pathway for electrical [[telemetry]] for communication between the surface and equipment at the end of the cable.
[[File:Inside Weatherfords Wireline truck.JPG|thumb|Inside a Wireline truck]]

On the other hand, wirelines are electric cables that transmit data about the well. Consisting of single strands or multi-strands, the wireline is used for both well intervention and formation evaluation operations. In other words, wirelines are useful in gathering data about the well in logging activities, as well as in workover jobs that require data transmittal.

==Wireline logs==

First developed by Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger in 1927, wireline logs measure formation properties in a well through electrical lines of wire. Different from [[measurement while drilling]] (MWD) and mud logs, wireline logs are constant downhole measurements sent through the electrical wireline used to help geologists, drillers and engineers make real-time decisions about drilling operations. Wireline logs can measure resistivity, conductivity and formation pressure, as well as sonic properties and wellbore dimensions.

The logging tool, also called a [[wikt:sonde|sonde]], is located at the bottom of the wireline. The measurements are taken by lowering the wireline to the prescribed depth and then raising it out of the well. The measurements are taken continuously on the way up, in an effort to sustain tension on the line.

==Workover operations==

When producing wells require remedial work to sustain, restore or enhance production, this is called workover. Many times, workover operations require production shut-in, but not always.

==Slickline firing head system==

In workover operations, a well-servicing unit is used to winch items in and out of the wellbore. The line used to raise and lower equipment can be braided steel wireline or a single steel slickline. Workover operations conducted can include well clean-up, setting plugs, production logging and perforation through explosives.

==Wireline tools==

Wireline tools are specially designed instruments lowered into a well bore on the end of the wireline cable. They are individually designed to provide any number of particular services, such as evaluation of the rock properties, the location of casing collars, formation pressures, information regarding the pore size or fluid identification and sample recovery. Modern wireline tools can be extremely complicated, and are often engineered to withstand very harsh conditions such as those found in many modern oil, gas, and geothermal wells. Pressures in gas wells can exceed 30,000 psi, while temperatures can exceed 500 deg Fahrenheit in some geothermal wells. Corrosive or carcinogenic gases such as [[hydrogen sulfide]] can also occur downhole.

To reduce the amount of time running in the well, several wireline tools are often joined together and run simultaneously in a tool string that can be hundreds of feet long and weigh more than 5000 lbs.

=== Natural gamma ray tools ===
Natural gamma ray tools are designed to measure gamma radiation in the Earth caused by the disintegration of naturally occurring potassium, uranium, and thorium. Unlike nuclear tools, these natural gamma ray tools emit no radiation. The tools have a radiation sensor, which is usually a scintillation crystal that emits a light pulse proportional to the strength of the gamma ray striking it. This light pulse is then converted to a current pulse by means of a photomultiplier tube (PMT). From the photomultiplier tube, the current pulse goes to the tool's electronics for further processing and ultimately to the surface system for recording. The strength of the received gamma rays is dependent on the source emitting gamma rays, the density of the formation, and the distance between the source and the tool detector. The log recorded by this tool is used to identify [[lithology]], estimate shale content, and depth correlation of future logs.

=== Nuclear tools ===
[[File:Putting the radioactive charge in the wireline string.JPG|thumb|Putting the radioactive charge in the wireline string]]
[[File:Locked case for Radioactive Source for Logging Job.JPG|thumb|Locked case for radioactive source for logging job]]
Nuclear tools measure formation properties through the interaction of reservoir molecules with radiation emitted from the logging tool. The two most common properties measured by nuclear tools are formation porosity and rock density: 

Formation porosity is determined by installing a [[neutron source|radiation source capable of emitting fast neutrons]] into the downhole environment. Any pore spaces in the rock are filled with fluid containing hydrogen atoms, which slow the neutrons down to an epithermal or thermal state. This atomic interaction creates gamma rays which are then measured in the tool through dedicated detectors, and interpreted through a calibration to a porosity. A higher number of gamma rays collected at the tool sensor would indicate a larger number of interactions with hydrogen atoms, and thus a larger porosity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slb.com/content/services/evaluation/petrophysics/porosity/cnl.asp Schlumberger, Compensated Neutron Log&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508160819/http://www.slb.com/content/services/evaluation/petrophysics/porosity/cnl.asp |date=2008-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most open hole nuclear tools utilize double-encapsulated chemical sources.

Density tools use gamma ray radiation to determine the lithology and density of the rock in the downhole environment.  Modern density tools utilize a Cs-137 radioactive source to generate gamma rays which interact with the rock strata. Since higher density materials absorb gamma rays much better than lower density materials, a gamma ray detector in the wire line tool is able to accurately determine formation density by measuring the number and associated energy level of returning gamma rays that have interacted with the rock matrix.  Density tools usually incorporate an extendable caliper arm, which is used both to press the radioactive source and detectors against the side of the bore and also to measure the exact width of the bore in order to remove the effect of varying bore diameter on the readings.

Some modern nuclear tools use an electronically powered source controlled from the surface to generate neutrons. By emitting neutrons of varying energies, the logging engineer is able to determine formation lithology in fractional percentages.

=== Resistivity tools ===
In any matrix which has some porosity, the pore spaces will be filled with a fluid of oil, gas (either hydrocarbon or otherwise) or formation water (sometimes referred to as connate water). This fluid will saturate the rock and change its electrical properties. A wireline resistivity tool direct injects current (lateralog-type tools for conductive water based muds) or induces (induction-type tools for resistive or oil based muds) an electric current into the surrounding rock and determines the resistivity via Ohm's law. The resistivity of the formation is used primarily to identify pay zones containing highly resistive hydrocarbons as opposed to those containing water, which is generally more conductive. It is also useful for determining the location of the [[water contact|oil-water contact]] in a reservoir. Most wireline tools are able to measure the resistivity at several depths of investigation into the bore hole wall, allowing log analysts to accurately predict the level of fluid invasion from the drilling mud, and thus determine a qualitative measurement of permeability.

Some resistivity tools have many electrodes mounted on several articulated pads, allowing for multiple micro-resistivity measurements. These micro-resistivities have a very shallow depth of investigation, typically in the range of 0.1 to 0.8 inches, making them suitable for borehole imaging. Resistivity imagers are available which operate using induction methods for resistive mud systems (oil base), and direct current methods for conductive mud systems (water based).

=== Sonic and ultrasonic tools ===
Sonic tools, such as the Baker Hughes XMAC-F1, consist of multiple piezoelectric transducers and receivers mounted on the tool body at fixed distances. The transmitters generate a pattern of sound waves at varying operating frequencies into the down hole formation. The signal path leaves the transmitter, passes through the mud column, travels along the borehole wall and is collected at multiple receivers spaced out along the tool body. The time it takes for the sound wave to travel through the rock is dependent on a number of properties of the existing rock, including formation porosity, lithology, permeability and rock strength. Different types of pressure waves can be generated in specific axis, allowing geoscientists to determine anisotropic stress regimes. This is very important in determining hole stability and aids drilling engineers in planning for future well design.

Sonic tools are also used extensively to evaluate the cement bond between casing and formation in a completed well, primarily by calculating the accentuation of the signal after it as passed through the casing wall (see [[#Cement Bond Tools|Cement Bond Tools]] below).

Ultrasonic tools use a rotating acoustic transducer to map a 360 degree image of the borehole as the logging tool is pulled to surface. This is especially useful for determining small scale bedding and formation dip, as well as identifying drilling artifacts such as spiraling or induced fractures.

=== Nuclear magnetic resonance tools ===
A measurement of the [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) properties of hydrogen in the formation. There are two phases to the measurement: polarization and acquisition. First, the hydrogen atoms are aligned in the direction of a static magnetic field (B0). This polarization takes a characteristic time T1. Second, the hydrogen atoms are tipped by a short burst from an oscillating magnetic field that is designed so that they precess in resonance in a plane perpendicular to B0. The frequency of oscillation is the Larmor frequency. The precession of the hydrogen atoms induces a signal in the antenna. The decay of this signal with time is caused by transverse relaxation and is measured by the [http://www.mr-tip.com/serv1.php?type=db1&amp;dbs=Carr%20Purcell%20Meiboom%20Gill%20Sequence CPMG pulse sequence]. The decay is the sum of different decay times, called T2. The T2 distribution is the basic output of a NMR measurement.

The NMR measurement made by both a laboratory instrument and a logging tool follow the same principles very closely. An important feature of the NMR measurement is the time needed to acquire it. In the laboratory, time presents no difficulty. In a log, there is a trade-off between the time needed for polarization and acquisition, logging speed and frequency of sampling. The longer the polarization and acquisition, the more complete the measurement. However, the longer times require either lower logging speed or less frequent sampling.

=== Borehole seismic tools ===

===Cased hole electric line tools===

====Cement bond tools====
A [[cement bond tool]], or CBT, is an [[acoustics|acoustic]] tool used to measure the quality of the cement behind the [[casing (borehole)|casing]].  Using a CBT, the bond between the casing and cement as well as the bond between cement and formation can be determined.  Using CBT data, a company can troubleshoot problems with the cement sheath if necessary.  This tool must be centralized in the well to function properly.

Two of the largest problems found in cement by CBT's are channeling and micro-annulus.  A micro annulus is the formation of microscopic cracks in the cement sheath.  Channeling is where large, contiguous voids in the cement sheath form, typically caused by poor centralization of the casing.  Both of these situations can, if necessary, be fixed by remedial electric line work.

A CBT makes its measurements by rapidly pulsing out [[compressional wave]]s across the well bore and into the pipe, cement, and formation.  The compressional pulse originates in a [[transmitter]] at the top of the tool, which, when powered up on surface sounds like a rapid clicking sound.  The tool typically has two receivers, one three feet away from the receiver, and another at five feet from the transmitter.  These receivers record the arrival time of the compressional waves. The information from these receivers are logged as traveltimes for the three and five foot receivers and as a micro-[[seismogram]].

Recent advances in logging technologies have allowed the receivers to measure 360 degrees of cement integrity and can be represented on a log as a radial cement map and as 6-8 individual sector arrival times.

====Casing collar locators====
Casing collar locator tools, or CCL's, are among the simplest and most essential in cased hole electric line.  CCL's are typically used for depth correlation and can be an indicator of line overspeed when logging in heavy fluids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coiledtubingdrilling.com/ctd/coiled-tubing/technology/] AnTech CCL Tool within CTD Offering&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:CCL Log.png|thumb|CCL Log]]
A CCL operates on [[Faraday's Law of Induction]].  Two magnets are separated by a coil of copper wire.  As the CCL passes by a casing joint, or collar, the difference in metal thickness across the two magnets induces a current spike in the coil.  This current spike is sent uphole and logged as what's called a collar kick on the cased hole log.&lt;ref&gt;http://wirelinehq.com/wireline-basics/wireline-casing-collar-locator/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gamma perforating tools====
A cased hole gamma perforator is used to perform mechanical services, such as shooting [[Perforation (oil well)|perforations]], setting downhole tubing/casing elements, dumping remedial cement, tracer surveys, etc.  Typically, a gamma perforator will have some sort of explosively initiated device attached to it, such as a perforating gun, a setting tool, or a dump bailor.  In certain instances, the gamma perforator is used to merely spot objects in the well, as in tubing conveyed perforating operations and tracer surveys.

Gamma perforators operate in much the same way as an open hole natural gamma ray tool.  Gamma rays given off from naturally occurring radioactive elements bombard the scintillation detector mounted on the tool.  The tool processes the gamma ray counts and sends the data uphole where it processed by a computerized acquisition system, and plotted on a log versus depth.  The information is then used to ensure that the depth shown on the log is correct.  After that, power can be applied through the tool to set off explosive charges for things like perforating, setting plugs or packers, dumping cement, etc.

====Wireline pressure setting assemblies (WLSPA)====
Setting tools are used to set downhole completion elements such as production packers or bridge plugs.  Setting tools typically use the expanding gas energy from a slow burning explosive charge to drive a hydraulic piston assembly. The assembly is attached to the plug or packer by means of a setting mandrel and a sliding sleeve, which when "stroked" by the piston assembly, effectively squeezes the elastomer elements of the packing element, deforming it sufficiently to wedge it into place in the tubing or casing string. Most completion packers or plugs have a specially designed shear mechanism which release the setting tool from the element allowing it to be retrieved back to surface. The packer/plug however, remains down hole as a barrier to isolate production zones or permanently plug off a well bore.


'''Casing Expander Tools'''

Expansion tools incorporate similar design features to WLSPA, using an internal piston assembly, except the main differences are that the piston is bi-directional, and does not detach to be left downhole. A hardened set of contoured pads expand when the piston is "stroked", indenting a small circle in the inner wall of the casing, and expanding the overall casing to make full contact with cement, packing material, or directly with the formation wall. The original design and concept of the tool was to stop surface casing pressure without impacting production by leaving hardware in the well bore. They can also be used in other applications like plugging and abandoning or drilling intervention operations like setting whipstocks.

==Additional equipment==

===Cable head===
The cable head is the upper most portion of the toolstring on any given type of wireline.  The cable head is where the conductor wire is made into an electrical connection that can be connected to the rest of the toolstring.  Cable heads are typically custom built by the wireline operator for every job and depend greatly on depth, pressure and the type of wellbore fluid.

Electric line weakpoints are also located in the cable head.  If the tool is to become stuck in the well, the weak point is where the tool would first separate from the wireline.  If the wireline were severed anywhere else along the line, the tool becomes much more difficult to fish.&lt;ref&gt;http://wirelinehq.com/wireline-basics/cablehead/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tractors===
Tractors are electrical tools used to push the toolstring into hole, overcoming wireline's disadvantage of being gravity dependent.  These are used for in highly deviated and horizontal wells where gravity is insufficient, even with roller stem.  They push against the side of the wellbore either through the use of wheels or through a wormlike motion.

===Measuring head===

A measuring head is the first piece of equipment the wireline comes into contact with off the drum.  The measuring head is composed of several wheels which support the wireline on its way to the winch and they also measure crucial wireline data.

A measuring head records tension, depth, and speed.  Current models use optical encoders to derive the revolutions of a wheel with a known circumference, which in turn is used to figure speed and depth.  A wheel with a pressure sensor is used to figure tension.

==Wireline apparatus==
[[File:wireline-wellhead.jpg|thumbnail|Wireline-wellhead]]
For [[oilfield]] work, the wireline resides on the surface, wound around a large (3 to 10 feet in diameter) spool. Operators may use a portable spool (on the back of a special truck) or a permanent part of the [[drilling rig]].  A motor and drive train turn the spool and raise and lower the equipment into and out of the well &amp;ndash; the [[winch]].

==Pressure control during wireline operations==
The pressure control employed during wireline operations is intended to contain pressure originating from the well bore.  During open hole electric line operations, the pressure might be the result from a well kicking.  During cased hole electric line, this is most likely the result of a well producing at high pressures.  Pressure equipment must be rated to well over the expected well pressures.  Normal ratings for wireline pressure equipment is 5,000, 10,000, and 15,000 pounds per square inch. Some wells are contained with 20,000 psi and 30,000 psi equipment is in development also.

===Flange===

A flange attaches to the top of the Christmas tree, usually with some sort of adapter for the rest of the pressure control.  A metal gasket is placed between the top of the Christmas tree and the flange to keep in well pressures.

===Wireline valve===

A wireline control valve, also called a wireline blow out preventer(BOP), is an enclosed device with one or more rams capable of closing over the wireline in an emergency.  A dual wireline valve has two sets of rams and some have the capability of pumping grease in the space between the rams to counterbalance the well pressure.

===Lubricator===
Lubricator is the term used for sections of pressure tested pipe that act to seal in wireline tools during pressurization.
As stated it is a series of pipes that connect and it is what holds the tool string so operators can make runs in and out of the well. It has valves to bleed off pressure so that you can disconnect it from the well and work on tools, etc.

===Pump-in sub===
Pump-in subs (also known as a flow T) allow for the injection of fluid into the pressure control string.  Normally these are used for wellsite pressure testing, which is typically performed between every run into the well.  They can also be used to bleed off pressure from the string after a run in the well, or to pump in kill fluids to control a wild well.
[[File:Wireline Grease-head.JPG|thumb|Wireline Greasehead used for pressure control]]

===Grease injector head===
The grease injector head is the main apparatus for controlling well pressure while running into the hole.  The grease head uses a series of very small pipes, called flow tubes, to decrease the pressure head of the well.  Grease is injected at high pressure into the bottom portion of the grease head to counteract the remaining well pressure.

===Pack-off===
Pack-off subs utilize hydraulic pressure on a two brass fittings which compress a rubber sealing element to create a seal around the wireline.  Pack-offs can be hand pumped or compressed through a motorized pumping unit.
[[File:Pack-off.png|thumb|Wireline Roller-top Pack-off]]

===Line wiper===
A line wiper operates in much the same way as a pack-off sub, except that the rubber element is much softer.  Hydraulic pumps exert force on the rubber element until a light pressure is exerted on the wireline, cleaning grease and well fluid off the line in the process.

===Quick test sub===
A quick test sub (QTS) is used when pressure testing the pressure control equipment (PCE) for repetitive operations. The PCE is pressure tested and then broke at the QTS afterwards to avoid having to retest the entire string. The PCE is then reconnected at the QTS. The QTS has two O-rings where it was disconnected that can be tested with hydraulic pressure to confirm the PCE can still hold the pressure it was tested to.

===Ball-check valve===
If the wireline were to become severed from the tool, a ball check valve can seal the well off from the surface.  During wireline operations, a steel ball sits to the side of a confined area within the grease head while the cable runs in and out of the hole.  If the wireline exits that confined area under pressure, the pressure will force the steel ball up towards the hole where the wireline had been.  The ball's diameter is larger than that of the hole, so the ball effectively seals off pressure to the surface.

===Head catcher===
A head catcher is a device placed at the top of the lubricator section.  Should the wireline tools be forced into the top of the lubricator section, the head catcher, which looks like a small 'claw,' will clamp down on the fishing neck of the tool.  This action prevents the tools from falling downhole should the line pull out of the rope socket.  Pressure is bled off of the head catcher to release the tools.

===Tool trap===
A tool trap has the same purpose as a head catcher in that it prevents the tools from inadvertently dropping down the hole.

=== Quick-Connect Sub ===
A subassembly device that is bolted to the top of the BOP stack that is designed to eliminate traditional bolt-flanges to connect lubricator heads and utilize tapered-wedge and lock ring designs. This allows the same security of traditional pressure control connections but a significant time savings component.
